166 the phrase    in whole or in part    has been subject to much discussion by scholars of international humanitarian law   the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia found in prosecutor v  radislav krstic   trial chamber i   judgment   it 98 33   2001   icty8   2 august 2001   that genocide had been committed   in prosecutor v  radislav krstic   appeals chamber   judgment   it 98 33   2004   icty 7   19 april 2004   paragraphs 8   9   10   and 11 addressed the issue of in part and found that    the part must be a substantial part of that group   the aim of the genocide convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups   and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole      the appeals chamber goes into details of other cases and the opinions of respected commentators on the genocide convention to explain how they came to this conclusion
in the judgement   it is stated that the aim of the genocide convention   at its most simplest   is preventing the destruction of which victims	entire human groups	105	107
167 in the same judgement the echr reviewed the judgements of several international and municipal courts judgements   it noted that international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and the international court of justice had agreed with the narrow interpretation   that biological physical destruction was necessary for an act to qualify as genocide   the echr also noted that at the time of its judgement   apart from courts in germany which had taken a broad view   that there had been few cases of genocide under other convention states municipal laws and that    there are no reported cases in which the courts of these states have defined the type of group destruction the perpetrator must have intended in order to be found guilty of genocide
two bodies of the united nations agreed with what restricted provision in defining genocide	that biological physical destruction was necessary	38	43
168 after the holocaust   which had been perpetrated by the nazi germany and its allies prior to and during world war ii   lemkin successfully campaigned for the universal acceptance of international laws defining and forbidding genocides   in 1946   the first session of the united nations general assembly adopted a resolution that    affirmed    that genocide was a crime under international law   but did not provide a legal definition of the crime   in 1948   the un general assembly adopted the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide   cppcg   which defined the crime of genocide for the first time

169 the first draft of the convention included political killings   but these provisions were removed in a political and diplomatic compromise following objections from some countries   including the ussr   a permanent security council member   the ussr argued that the convention  s definition should follow the etymology of the term   and may have feared greater international scrutiny of its own great purge   other nations feared that including political groups in the definition would invite international intervention in domestic politics   however leading genocide scholar william schabas states    rigorous examination of the travaux fails to confirm a popular impression in the literature that the opposition to inclusion of political genocide was some soviet machination   the soviet views were also shared by a number of other states for whom it is difficult to establish any geographic or social common denominator   lebanon   sweden   brazil   peru   venezuela   the philippines   the dominican republic   iran   egypt   belgium   and uruguay   the exclusion of political groups was in fact originally promoted by a non governmental organization   the world jewish congress   and it corresponded to raphael lemkin s vision of the nature of the crime of genocide

170 in 2007 the european court of human rights   echr     noted in its judgement on jorgic v  germany case that in 1992 the majority of legal scholars took the narrow view that    intent to destroy    in the cppcg meant the intended physical biological destruction of the protected group and that this was still the majority opinion   but the echr also noted that a minority took a broader view and did not consider biological physical destruction was necessary as the intent to destroy a national   racial   religious or ethnic group was enough to qualify as genocide

171 the word genocide was later included as a descriptive term to the process of indictment   but not yet as a formal legal term according to lemming   genocide was defined as    a coordinated strategy to destroy a group of people   a process that could be accomplished through total annihilation as well as strategies that eliminate key elements of the group  s basic existence   including language   culture   and economic infrastructure   he created a concept of mobilizing much of the international relations and community   to working together and preventing the occurrence of such events happening within history and the international society   australian anthropologist peg levine coined the term    ritualcide    to describe the destruction of a group  s cultural identity without necessarily destroying its members

172 the study of genocide has mainly been focused towards the legal aspect of the term   by formally recognizing the act of genocide as a crime   involves the undergoing prosecution that begins with not only seeing genocide as outrageous past any moral standpoint but also may be a legal liability within international relations   when genocide is looked at in a general aspect it is viewed as the deliberate killing of a certain group   yet is commonly seen to escape the process of trial and prosecution due to the fact that genocide is more often than not committed by the officials in power of a state or area   in 1648 before the term genocide had been coined   the peace of westphalia was established to protect ethnic   national   racial and in some instances religious groups   during the 19th century humanitarian intervention was needed due to the fact of conflict and justification of some of the actions executed by the military

173 genocide has become an official term used in international relations   the word genocide was not in use before 1944  before this   in 1941   winston churchill described the mass killing of russian prisoners of war and civilians as    a crime without a name      in that year   a polish jewish lawyer named raphael lemkin   described the policies of systematic murder founded by the nazis as genocide   the word genocide is the combination of the greek prefix geno    meaning tribe or race   and caedere   the latin word for to kill     the word is defined as a specific set of violent crimes that are committed against a certain group with the attempt to remove the entire group from existence or to destroy them
when was the word    genocide    first used	1944	18	18
174 the judges continue in paragraph 12      the determination of when the targeted part is substantial enough to meet this requirement may involve a number of considerations   the numeric size of the targeted part of the group is the necessary and important starting point   though not in all cases the ending point of the inquiry   the number of individuals targeted should be evaluated not only in absolute terms   but also in relation to the overall size of the entire group   in addition to the numeric size of the targeted portion   its prominence within the group can be a useful consideration   if a specific part of the group is emblematic of the overall group   or is essential to its survival   that may support a finding that the part qualifies as substantial within the meaning of article 4   of the tribunal  s statute
several considerations were involved in meeting the requirement to determine what	when the targeted part is substantial enough	9	15
175 in paragraph 13 the judges raise the issue of the perpetrators   access to the victims      the historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators  activity and control   as well as the possible extent of their reach   should be considered       the intent to destroy formed by a perpetrator of genocide will always be limited by the opportunity presented to him   while this factor alone will not indicate whether the targeted group is substantial   it can in combination with other factors inform the analysis

176 the convention came into force as international law on 12 january 1951 after the minimum 20 countries became parties   at that time however   only two of the five permanent members of the un security council were parties to the treaty   france and the republic of china   the soviet union ratified in 1954   the united kingdom in 1970   the people  s republic of china in 1983   having replaced the taiwan based republic of china on the unsc in 1971     and the united states in 1988  this long delay in support for the convention by the world  s most powerful nations caused the convention to languish for over four decades   only in the 1990s did the international law on the crime of genocide begin to be enforced

177 writing in 1998 kurt jonassohn and karin bj rnson stated that the cppcg was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise   as such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool   and although it is used for this purpose   as it has an international legal credibility that others lack   other definitions have also been postulated   jonassohn and bj rnson go on to say that none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support for various reasons
in 1998 it was written that the cppcg was a legal entity resulting in which type of compromise	a diplomatic compromise	19	21
178 jonassohn and bj rnson postulate that the major reason why no single generally accepted genocide definition has emerged is because academics have adjusted their focus to emphasise different periods and have found it expedient to use slightly different definitions to help them interpret events   for example   frank chalk and kurt jonassohn studied the whole of human history   while leo kuper and r  j  rummel in their more recent works concentrated on the 20th century   and helen fein   barbara harff and ted gurr have looked at post world war ii events   jonassohn and bj rnson are critical of some of these studies   arguing that they are too expansive   and conclude that the academic discipline of genocide studies is too young to have a canon of work on which to build an academic paradigm

179 the exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the cppcg legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists   for example m  hassan kakar in his book the soviet invasion and the afghan response   1979 1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted   and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes chalk and jonassohn      genocide is a form of one sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group   as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator      while there are various definitions of the term   adam jones states that the majority of genocide scholars consider that    intent to destroy    is a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide   and that there is growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion
some historians were critical of what exclusion in the definition of victims of genocide	social and political groups	3	6
180 barbara harff and ted gurr defined genocide as    the promotion and execution of policies by a state or its agents which result in the deaths of a substantial portion of a group       when   the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics   i e    ethnicity   religion or nationality      harff and gurr also differentiate between genocides and politicides by the characteristics by which members of a group are identified by the state   in genocides   the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics   i e    ethnicity   religion or nationality   in politicides the victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups   daniel d  polsby and don b  kates   jr  state that        we follow harff  s distinction between genocides and  pogroms     which she describes as  short lived outbursts by mobs   which   although often condoned by authorities   rarely persist     if the violence persists for long enough   however   harff argues   the distinction between condonation and complicity collapses

181 according to r  j  rummel   genocide has 3 different meanings   the ordinary meaning is murder by government of people due to their national   ethnic   racial   or religious group membership   the legal meaning of genocide refers to the international treaty   the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide   this also includes non killings that in the end eliminate the group   such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children out of the group to another group   a generalized meaning of genocide is similar to the ordinary meaning but also includes government killings of political opponents or otherwise intentional murder   it is to avoid confusion regarding what meaning is intended that rummel created the term democide for the third meaning

182 highlighting the potential for state and non state actors to commit genocide in the 21st century   for example   in failed states or as non state actors acquire weapons of mass destruction   adrian gallagher defined genocide as  when a source of collective power   usually a state   intentionally uses its power base to implement a process of destruction in order to destroy a group   as defined by the perpetrator     in whole or in substantial part   dependent upon relative group size     the definition upholds the centrality of intent   the multidimensional understanding of destroy   broadens the definition of group identity beyond that of the 1948 definition yet argues that a substantial part of a group has to be destroyed before it can be classified as genocide   dependent on relative group size

183 all signatories to the cppcg are required to prevent and punish acts of genocide   both in peace and wartime   though some barriers make this enforcement difficult   in particular   some of the signatories namely   bahrain   bangladesh   india   malaysia   the philippines   singapore   the united states   vietnam   yemen   and former yugoslavia signed with the proviso that no claim of genocide could be brought against them at the international court of justice without their consent   despite official protests from other signatories   notably cyprus and norway   on the ethics and legal standing of these reservations   the immunity from prosecution they grant has been invoked from time to time   as when the united states refused to allow a charge of genocide brought against it by former yugoslavia following the 1999 kosovo war

189 there has been much debate over categorizing the situation in darfur as genocide   the ongoing conflict in darfur   sudan   which started in 2003   was declared a    genocide    by united states secretary of state colin powell on 9 september 2004 in testimony before the senate foreign relations committee   since that time however   no other permanent member of the un security council followed suit   in fact   in january 2005   an international commission of inquiry on darfur   authorized by un security council resolution 1564 of 2004   issued a report to the secretary general stating that    the government of the sudan has not pursued a policy of genocide      nevertheless   the commission cautioned that    the conclusion that no genocidal policy has been pursued and implemented in darfur by the government authorities   directly or through the militias under their control   should not be taken in any way as detracting from the gravity of the crimes perpetrated in that region   international offences such as the crimes against humanity and war crimes that have been committed in darfur may be no less serious and heinous than genocide

191 other authors have focused on the structural conditions leading up to genocide and the psychological and social processes that create an evolution toward genocide   ervin staub showed that economic deterioration and political confusion and disorganization were starting points of increasing discrimination and violence in many instances of genocides and mass killing   they lead to scapegoating a group and ideologies that identified that group as an enemy   a history of devaluation of the group that becomes the victim   past violence against the group that becomes the perpetrator leading to psychological wounds   authoritarian cultures and political systems   and the passivity of internal and external witnesses   bystanders   all contribute to the probability that the violence develops into genocide   intense conflict between groups that is unresolved   becomes intractable and violent can also lead to genocide   the conditions that lead to genocide provide guidance to early prevention   such as humanizing a devalued group   creating ideologies that embrace all groups   and activating bystander responses   there is substantial research to indicate how this can be done   but information is only slowly transformed into action

192 the emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon   emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy   the antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics   under certain conditions   it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria   while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug   for example   antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the luria delbr ck experiment   antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin   which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains   have become less effective   due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains

193 the successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors   these include host defense mechanisms   the location of infection   and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial   a bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase   and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells   these findings are based on laboratory studies   and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection   since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration   in vitro characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial   to predict clinical outcome   the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its pharmacokinetic profile   and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy

194 antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action   chemical structure   or spectrum of activity   most target bacterial functions or growth processes   those that target the bacterial cell wall   penicillins and cephalosporins   or the cell membrane   polymyxins     or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes   rifamycins   lipiarmycins   quinolones   and sulfonamides   have bactericidal activities   those that target protein synthesis   macrolides   lincosamides and tetracyclines   are usually bacteriostatic   with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides     further categorization is based on their target specificity      narrow spectrum    antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria   such as gram negative or gram positive bacteria   whereas broad spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria   following a 40 year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds   four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s   cyclic lipopeptides   such as daptomycin     glycylcyclines   such as tigecycline     oxazolidinones   such as linezolid     and lipiarmycins   such as fidaxomicin

195 with advances in medicinal chemistry   most modern antibacterials are semisynthetic modifications of various natural compounds   these include   for example   the beta lactam antibiotics   which include the penicillins   produced by fungi in the genus penicillium     the cephalosporins   and the carbapenems   compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the aminoglycosides   whereas other antibacterials for example   the sulfonamides   the quinolones   and the oxazolidinones are produced solely by chemical synthesis   many antibacterial compounds are relatively small molecules with a molecular weight of less than 2000 atomic mass units     citation needed

196 antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century   and have together with vaccination led to the near eradication of diseases such as tuberculosis in the developed world   their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse   especially in livestock raising   prompting bacteria to develop resistance   this has led to widespread problems with antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance   so much as to prompt the world health organization to classify antimicrobial resistance as a    serious threat   that   is no longer a prediction for the future   it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone   of any age   in any country

198 antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use   and are usually considered safe and most are well tolerated   however   some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse side effects   side effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used   the microbial organisms targeted   and the individual patient   side effects may reflect the pharmacological or toxicological properties of the antibiotic or may involve hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis   safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use   adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions   including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis   common side effects include diarrhea   resulting from disruption of the species composition in the intestinal flora   resulting   for example   in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria   such as clostridium difficile   antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora   and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus candida in the vulvo vaginal area   additional side effects can result from interaction with other drugs   such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid   some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease

199 exposure to antibiotics early in life is associated with increased body mass in humans and mouse models   early life is a critical period for the establishment of the intestinal microbiota and for metabolic development   mice exposed to subtherapeutic antibiotic treatment   stat     with either penicillin   vancomycin   penicillin and vancomycin   or chlortetracycline had altered composition of the gut microbiota as well as its metabolic capabilities   moreover   research have shown that mice given low dose penicillin   1  g g body weight   around birth and throughout the weaning process had an increased body mass and fat mass   accelerated growth   and increased hepatic expression of genes involved in adipogenesis   compared to controlled mice   in addition   penicillin in combination with a high fat diet increased fasting insulin levels in mice   however   it is unclear whether or not antibiotics cause obesity in humans   studies have found a correlation between early exposure of antibiotics     6 months   and increased body mass   at 10 and 20 months     another study found that the type of antibiotic exposure was also significant with the highest risk of being overweight in those given macrolides compared to penicillin and cephalosporin   therefore   there is correlation between antibiotic exposure in early life and obesity in humans   but whether or not there is a causal relationship remains unclear   although there is a correlation between antibiotic use in early life and obesity   the effect of antibiotics on obesity in humans needs to be weighed against the beneficial effects of clinically indicated treatment with antibiotics in infancy

200 the majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills   such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low   about 1       in cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills   such as for the broad spectrum antibacterial rifampicin   these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes   causing increased breakdown of the pill  s active ingredients   effects on the intestinal flora   which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon   have also been suggested   but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial   clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives

201 interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy   while moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to interfere with many common antibiotics   there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol consumption may cause serious side effects   therefore   potential risks of side effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered   despite the lack of a categorical counterindication   the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread

202 several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist   intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains   for example   an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome   acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra chromosomal dna   antibacterial producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to   and may have been transferred to   antibacterial resistant strains   the spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of dna by horizontal genetic exchange   for instance   antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes   plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials   cross resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound

203 antibacterial resistant strains and species   sometimes referred to as    superbugs      now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled   for example   emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis   tb   that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges   every year   nearly half a million new cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis   mdr tb   are estimated to occur worldwide   for example   ndm 1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta lactam antibacterials   the united kingdom  s health protection agency has stated that    most isolates with ndm 1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections

204 inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria   self prescription of antibiotics is an example of misuse   many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment   also   incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections   the overuse of antibiotics   like penicillin and erythromycin   has been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s   widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics

205 common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of prophylactic antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient  s weight and history of prior use   other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic   incorrect dosage and administration   or failure to rest for sufficient recovery   inappropriate antibiotic treatment   for example   is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the common cold   one study on respiratory tract infections found    physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them      multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics

207 the emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the uk in 1970   swann report 1969     and the eu has banned the use of antibiotics as growth promotional agents since 2003  moreover   several organizations   e g    the american society for microbiology   asm     american public health association   apha   and the american medical association   ama     have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses     citation needed   however   commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics   attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics   and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them   two federal bills   s 742 and h r   2562   aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in us food animals were proposed   but have not passed   these bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations   including the american holistic nurses   association   the american medical association   and the american public health association   apha

209 before the early 20th century   treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore   mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago   many ancient cultures   including the ancient egyptians and ancient greeks   used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections   more recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms   louis pasteur observed      if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria   it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics      the term  antibiosis     meaning    against life      was introduced by the french bacteriologist jean paul vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs   antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when louis pasteur and robert koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of bacillus anthracis   these drugs were later renamed antibiotics by selman waksman   an american microbiologist   in 1942  synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in germany with paul ehrlich in the late 1880s   ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human   animal   or bacterial cells   whereas others did not   he then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host   after screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms   in 1907   he discovered a medicinally useful drug   the synthetic antibacterial salvarsan now called arsphenamine

213 florey and chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin   penicillin g   in 1942   but it did not become widely available outside the allied military before 1945  later   norman heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk   the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by dorothy crowfoot hodgkin in 1945  purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans   furthermore   its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus   unlike the synthetic sulfonamides   the discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented   and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety   for their successful development of penicillin   which fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself   as a therapeutic drug   ernst chain and howard florey shared the 1945 nobel prize in medicine with fleming   florey credited dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds   which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived florey  s research in penicillin

214 vaccines rely on immune modulation or augmentation   vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection   leading to the activation of macrophages   the production of antibodies   inflammation   and other classic immune reactions   antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases   vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic   cell free vaccines consisting of purified components   including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates   to protein carriers   as well as inactivated toxins   toxoids   and proteins

215 phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria   the way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses   more specifically   bacteriophages   bacteriophages   also known simply as phages   are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles   by disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium   phages destroy their metabolism   which eventually results in the cell  s death   phages will insert their dna into the bacterium   allowing their dna to be transcribed   once their dna is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released   the cell will lyse   one of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect    good    bacteria   or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings   however   studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria   which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria

237 at the end of 1831   chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when robert schumann   reviewing the op   2 variations in the allgemeine musikalische zeitung   his first published article on music     declared      hats off   gentlemen   a genius      on 26 february 1832 chopin gave a debut paris concert at the salle pleyel which drew universal admiration   the critic fran ois joseph f tis wrote in the revue et gazette musicale      here is a young man who     taking no model   has found   if not a complete renewal of piano music       an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else        after this concert   chopin realized that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces   later that year he was introduced to the wealthy rothschild banking family   whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private salons   social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite     by the end of 1832 chopin had established himself among the parisian musical elite   and had earned the respect of his peers such as hiller   liszt   and berlioz   he no longer depended financially upon his father   and in the winter of 1832 he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over europe   this freed him from the strains of public concert giving   which he disliked

238 chopin seldom performed publicly in paris   in later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the salle pleyel   a venue that seated three hundred   he played more frequently at salons   but preferred playing at his own paris apartment for small groups of friends   the musicologist arthur hedley has observed that    as a pianist chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime      the list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts provides an indication of the richness of parisian artistic life during this period   examples include a concert on 23 march 1833   in which chopin   liszt and hiller performed   on pianos   a concerto by j s   bach for three keyboards   and   on 3 march 1838   a concert in which chopin   his pupil adolphe gutmann   charles valentin alkan   and alkan  s teacher joseph zimmermann performed alkan  s arrangement   for eight hands   of two movements from beethoven  s 7th symphony   chopin was also involved in the composition of liszt  s hexameron   he wrote the sixth   and final   variation on bellini  s theme   chopin  s music soon found success with publishers   and in 1833 he contracted with maurice schlesinger   who arranged for it to be published not only in france but   through his family connections   also in germany and england

240 although it is not known exactly when chopin first met liszt after arriving in paris   on 12 december 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend woyciechowski that    i have met rossini   cherubini   baillot   etc  also kalkbrenner   you would not believe how curious i was about herz   liszt   hiller   etc      liszt was in attendance at chopin  s parisian debut on 26 february 1832 at the salle pleyel   which led him to remark      the most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician   who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art

241 the two became friends   and for many years lived in close proximity in paris   chopin at 38 rue de la chauss e d antin   and liszt at the h tel de france on the rue lafitte   a few blocks away   they performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841  the first   on 2 april 1833   was at a benefit concert organized by hector berlioz for his bankrupt shakespearean actress wife harriet smithson   during which they played george onslow  s sonata in f minor for piano duet   later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the benevolent association of polish ladies in paris   their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the beethoven memorial in bonn   held at the salle pleyel and the paris conservatory on 25 and 26 april 1841

242 although the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other   their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love hate relationship   harold c  schonberg believes that chopin displayed a    tinge of jealousy and spite    towards liszt  s virtuosity on the piano   and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with liszt  s theatricality   showmanship and success   liszt was the dedicatee of chopin  s op   10  tudes   and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to hiller      i should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies      however   chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments   at which chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all   forcing an apology   most biographers of chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other   although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as    my friend liszt      some commentators point to events in the two men  s romantic lives which led to a rift between them   there are claims that liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress marie d agoult  s obsession with chopin   while others believe that chopin had become concerned about liszt  s growing relationship with george sand

244 in june 1837 chopin visited london incognito in the company of the piano manufacturer camille pleyel where he played at a musical soir e at the house of english piano maker james broadwood   on his return to paris   his association with sand began in earnest   and by the end of june 1838 they had become lovers   sand   who was six years older than the composer   and who had had a series of lovers   wrote at this time      i must say i was confused and amazed at the effect this little creature had on me     i have still not recovered from my astonishment   and if i were a proud person i should be feeling humiliated at having been carried away        the two spent a miserable winter on majorca   8 november 1838 to 13 february 1839     where   together with sand  s two children   they had journeyed in the hope of improving the health of chopin and that of sand  s 15 year old son maurice   and also to escape the threats of sand  s former lover f licien mallefille   after discovering that the couple were not married   the deeply traditional catholic people of majorca became inhospitable   making accommodation difficult to find   this compelled the group to take lodgings in a former carthusian monastery in valldemossa   which gave little shelter from the cold winter weather

273 chopin was educated in the tradition of beethoven   haydn   mozart and clementi   he used clementi  s piano method with his own students   he was also influenced by hummel  s development of virtuoso   yet mozartian   piano technique   he cited bach and mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook   chopin  s early works are in the style of the    brilliant    keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of ignaz moscheles   friedrich kalkbrenner   and others   less direct in the earlier period are the influences of polish folk music and of italian opera   much of what became his typical style of ornamentation   for example   his fioriture   is taken from singing   his melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the modes and features of the music of his native country   such as drones

274 chopin took the new salon genre of the nocturne   invented by the irish composer john field   to a deeper level of sophistication   he was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces   he essentially established a new genre with his own set of free standing preludes   op   28   published 1839     he exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert  tude   already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by liszt   clementi and moscheles   in his two sets of studies   op   10 published in 1833   op   25 in 1837
who is credited with creating the nocturne	john field	14	15
275 chopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression   chopin  s mazurkas   while originating in the traditional polish dance   the mazurek     differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall      it was chopin who put the mazurka on the european musical map      the series of seven polonaises published in his lifetime   another nine were published posthumously     beginning with the op   26 pair   published 1836     set a new standard for music in the form   his waltzes were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance floor equivalents

276 some of chopin  s well known pieces have acquired descriptive titles   such as the revolutionary  tude   op   10   no   12     and the minute waltz   op   64   no   1     however   with the exception of his funeral march   the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number   leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener   the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others   there is no evidence to suggest that the revolutionary  tude was written with the failed polish uprising against russia in mind   it merely appeared at that time   the funeral march   the third movement of his sonata no   2   op   35     the one case where he did give a title   was written before the rest of the sonata   but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it

277 the last opus number that chopin himself used was 65   allocated to the cello sonata in g minor   he expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed   at the request of the composer  s mother and sisters   however   his musical executor julian fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers   opp   66 73     published in 1855  in 1857   17 polish songs that chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as op   74   though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition

278 works published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers   the present standard musicological reference for chopin  s works is the kobyla ska catalogue   usually represented by the initials  kk       named for its compiler   the polish musicologist krystyna kobyla ska

279 chopin  s original publishers included maurice schlesinger and camille pleyel   his works soon began to appear in popular 19th century piano anthologies   the first collected edition was by breitkopf   h rtel   1878 1902     among modern scholarly editions of chopin  s works are the version under the name of paderewski published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent polish    national edition      edited by jan ekier   both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources

280 improvisation stands at the centre of chopin  s creative processes   however   this does not imply impulsive rambling   nicholas temperley writes that    improvisation is designed for an audience   and its starting point is that audience  s expectations   which include the current conventions of musical form      the works for piano and orchestra   including the two concertos   are held by temperley to be    merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing     formally longwinded and extremely conservative      after the piano concertos   which are both early   dating from 1830     chopin made no attempts at large scale multi movement forms   save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello      instead he achieved near perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell structure      rosen suggests that an important aspect of chopin  s individuality is his flexible handling of the four bar phrase as a structural unit

281 j  barrie jones suggests that    amongst the works that chopin intended for concert use   the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme      and adds that    the barcarolle op   60 stands apart as an example of chopin  s rich harmonic palette coupled with an italianate warmth of melody      temperley opines that these works   which contain    immense variety of mood   thematic material and structural detail      are based on an extended    departure and return    form      the more the middle section is extended   and the further it departs in key   mood and theme   from the opening idea   the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes

282 chopin  s mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward ternary or episodic form   sometimes with a coda   the mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works   sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses   however   some also show unusual sophistication   for example op   63 no   3   which includes a canon at one beat  s distance   a great rarity in music

283 chopin  s polonaises show a marked advance on those of his polish predecessors in the form   who included his teachers zywny and elsner     as with the traditional polonaise   chopin  s works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies   accompaniments and cadences   unlike most of their precursors   they also require a formidable playing technique
what time are chopin  s polonaises written in	triple time	33	34
284 the 21 nocturnes are more structured   and of greater emotional depth   than those of field   whom chopin met in 1833     many of the chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression   and often making very difficult demands on the performer   which heightens their dramatic character

285 chopin  s  tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form   he used them to teach his own technique of piano playing for instance playing double thirds   op   25   no   6     playing in octaves   op   25   no   10     and playing repeated notes   op   10   no   7

286 the preludes   many of which are very brief   some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure     were described by schumann as    the beginnings of studies      inspired by j s   bach  s the well tempered clavier   chopin  s preludes move up the circle of fifths   rather than bach  s chromatic scale sequence   to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality   the preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group   and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces   or even to music by other composers   as kenneth hamilton suggests   he has noted a recording by ferruccio busoni of 1922   in which the prelude op   28 no   7 is followed by the  tude op   10 no   5

287 the two mature piano sonatas   no   2   op   35   written in 1839 and no   3   op   58   written in 1844   are in four movements   in op   35   chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique     a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the german sonata principle      the last movement   a brief   75 bar   perpetuum mobile in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout   was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries   including schumann   the op   58 sonata is closer to the german tradition   including many passages of complex counterpoint      worthy of brahms    according to the music historians kornel micha owski and jim samson
how many movements are no   2   op   35 and no   3   op 58 in	four	22	22
288 chopin  s harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique   temperley says that in his works    novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment      and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key   neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths     or by sudden shifts to remote keys   chord progressions sometimes anticipate the shifting tonality of later composers such as claude debussy   as does chopin  s use of modal harmony
chopin  s chord progressions are similar in style to what other composer	claude debussy	75	76
289 in 1841   l on escudier wrote of a recital given by chopin that year      one may say that chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition   in truth   nothing equals the lightness   the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano   moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality   distinction and grace      chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well   his style was based extensively on his use of very independent finger technique   in his projet de m thode he wrote      everything is a matter of knowing good fingering     we need no less to use the rest of the hand   the wrist   the forearm and the upper arm      he further stated      one needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound   to know how to play short notes and long notes   and   to attain   unlimited dexterity      the consequences of this approach to technique in chopin  s music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard   passages in double octaves and other chord groupings   swiftly repeated notes   the use of grace notes   and the use of contrasting rhythms   four against three   for example   between the hands
what was chopin  s style based upon	independent finger technique	93	95
290 polish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as moritz moszkowski   but   in the opinion of j  barrie jones   his    one worthy successor    among his compatriots was karol szymanowski   1882 1937     edvard grieg   anton n dvo  k   isaac alb niz   pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky and sergei rachmaninoff   among others   are regarded by critics as having been influenced by chopin  s use of national modes and idioms   alexander scriabin was devoted to the music of chopin   and his early published works include nineteen mazurkas   as well as numerous  tudes and preludes   his teacher nikolai zverev drilled him in chopin  s works to improve his virtuosity as a performer   in the 20th century   composers who paid homage to   or in some cases parodied   the music of chopin included george crumb   bohuslav martin    darius milhaud   igor stravinsky and heitor villa lobos

291 jonathan bellman writes that modern concert performance style set in the    conservatory    tradition of late 19th  and 20th century music schools   and suitable for large auditoria or recordings militates against what is known of chopin  s more intimate performance technique   the composer himself said to a pupil that    concerts are never real music   you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art      contemporary accounts indicate that in performance   chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him   such as    always crescendo to a high note      but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing   rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring   berlioz wrote in 1853 that chopin    has created a kind of chromatic embroidery     whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe     virtually nobody but chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn      hiller wrote that    what in the hands of others was elegant embellishment   in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers

292 chopin  s music is frequently played with rubato      the practice in performance of disregarding strict time    robbing   some note values for expressive effect      there are differing opinions as to how much   and what type   of rubato is appropriate for his works   charles rosen comments that    most of the written out indications of rubato in chopin are to be found in his mazurkas     it is probable that chopin used the older form of rubato so important to mozart       where   the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass     an allied form of this rubato is the arpeggiation of the chords thereby delaying the melody note   according to chopin  s pupil   karol mikuli   chopin was firmly opposed to this practice

294 with his mazurkas and polonaises   chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of nationalism   schumann   in his 1836 review of the piano concertos   highlighted the composer  s strong feelings for his native poland   writing that    now that the poles are in deep mourning   after the failure of the november 1830 rising     their appeal to us artists is even stronger     if the mighty autocrat in the north   i e   nicholas i of russia   could know that in chopin  s works   in the simple strains of his mazurkas   there lurks a dangerous enemy   he would place a ban on his music   chopin  s works are cannon buried in flowers      the biography of chopin published in 1863 under the name of franz liszt   but probably written by carolyne zu sayn wittgenstein   claims that chopin    must be ranked first among the first musicians     individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation

295 some modern commentators have argued against exaggerating chopin  s primacy as a    nationalist    or    patriotic    composer   george golos refers to earlier    nationalist    composers in central europe   including poland  s micha  kleofas ogi ski and franciszek lessel   who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms   barbara milewski suggests that chopin  s experience of polish music came more from    urbanised    warsaw versions than from folk music   and that attempts   by jachimecki and others   to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis   richard taruskin impugns schumann  s attitude toward chopin  s works as patronizing and comments that chopin    felt his polish patriotism deeply and sincerely    but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of bach   beethoven   schubert and field

296 jones comments that    chopin  s unique position as a composer   despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano   has rarely been questioned      he also notes that chopin was fortunate to arrive in paris in 1831     the artistic environment   the publishers who were willing to print his music   the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what chopin asked for their lessons     and these factors   as well as his musical genius   also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation   while his illness and his love affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of romanticism   the rarity of his public recitals   as opposed to performances at fashionable paris soir es   led arthur hutchings to suggest that    his lack of byronic flamboyance   and   his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional    among his romantic contemporaries   such as liszt and henri herz
arthur hutchings stated that chopin  s lack of what made him special	byronic flamboyance	118	119

299 the exact nature of relations between tibet and the ming dynasty of china   1368 1644   is unclear   analysis of the relationship is further complicated by modern political conflicts and the application of westphalian sovereignty to a time when the concept did not exist   some mainland chinese scholars   such as wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain   assert that the ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over tibet   pointing to the ming court  s issuing of various titles to tibetan leaders   tibetans   full acceptance of these titles   and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the ming capital   scholars within china also argue that tibet has been an integral part of china since the 13th century and that it was thus a part of the ming empire   but most scholars outside china   such as turrell v  wylie   melvin c  goldstein   and helmut hoffman   say that the relationship was one of suzerainty   that ming titles were only nominal   that tibet remained an independent region outside ming control   and that it simply paid tribute until the jiajing emperor   1521 1566     who ceased relations with tibet

300 some scholars note that tibetan leaders during the ming frequently engaged in civil war and conducted their own foreign diplomacy with neighboring states such as nepal   some scholars underscore the commercial aspect of the ming tibetan relationship   noting the ming dynasty  s shortage of horses for warfare and thus the importance of the horse trade with tibet   others argue that the significant religious nature of the relationship of the ming court with tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship   in hopes of reviving the unique relationship of the earlier mongol leader kublai khan   r  1260 1294   and his spiritual superior drog n ch gyal phagpa   1235 1280   of the sakya school of tibetan buddhism   the yongle emperor   r  1402 1424   made a concerted effort to build a secular and religious alliance with deshin shekpa   1384 1415     the karmapa of the karma kagyu school   however   the yongle emperor  s attempts were unsuccessful

301 the ming initiated sporadic armed intervention in tibet during the 14th century   but did not garrison permanent troops there   at times the tibetans also used armed resistance against ming forays   the wanli emperor   r  1572 1620   made attempts to reestablish sino tibetan relations after the mongol tibetan alliance initiated in 1578   which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent qing dynasty   1644 1912   of china in their support for the dalai lama of the gelug school   by the late 16th century   the mongols were successful armed protectors of the gelug dalai lama   after increasing their presence in the amdo region   this culminated in g shi khan  s   1582 1655   conquest of tibet from 1637 1642 and the establishment of the ganden phodrang regime by the 5th dalai lama with his help

303 during the five dynasties and ten kingdoms period of china   907 960     while the fractured political realm of china saw no threat in a tibet which was in just as much political disarray   there was little in the way of sino tibetan relations   few documents involving sino tibetan contacts survive from the song dynasty   960 1279     the song were far more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the khitan ruled liao dynasty   907 1125   and jurchen ruled jin dynasty   1115 1234

306 starting in 1236   the mongol prince kublai   who later ruled as khagan from 1260 1294   was granted a large appanage in north china by his superior    gedei khan   karma pakshi   2nd karmapa lama   1203 1283    the head lama of the karma kagyu lineage of tibetan buddhism rejected kublai  s invitation   so instead kublai invited drog n ch gyal phagpa   1235 1280     successor and nephew of sakya pandita   who came to his court in 1253  kublai instituted a unique relationship with the phagpa lama   which recognized kublai as a superior sovereign in political affairs and the phagpa lama as the senior instructor to kublai in religious affairs   kublai also made drog n ch gyal phagpa the director of the government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs and the ruling priest king of tibet   which comprised thirteen different states ruled by myriarchies

307 kublai khan did not conquer the song dynasty in south china until 1279   so tibet was a component of the early mongol empire before it was combined into one of its descendant empires with the whole of china under the yuan dynasty   1271 1368     van praag writes that this conquest    marked the end of independent china      which was then incorporated into the yuan dynasty that ruled china   tibet   mongolia   korea   parts of siberia and upper burma   morris rossabi   a professor of asian history at queens college   city university of new york   writes that    khubilai wished to be perceived both as the legitimate khan of khans of the mongols and as the emperor of china   though he had   by the early 1260s   become closely identified with china   he still   for a time   claimed universal rule      and yet    despite his successes in china and korea   khubilai was unable to have himself accepted as the great khan      thus   with such limited acceptance of his position as great khan   kublai khan increasingly became identified with china and sought support as emperor of china

308 in 1358   the sakya viceregal regime installed by the mongols in tibet was overthrown in a rebellion by the phagmodru myriarch tai situ changchub gyaltsen   1302 1364     the mongol yuan court was forced to accept him as the new viceroy   and changchub gyaltsen and his successors   the phagmodrupa dynasty   gained de facto rule over tibet

310 as evident in his imperial edicts   the hongwu emperor was well aware of the buddhist link between tibet and china and wanted to foster it   rolpe dorje   4th karmapa lama   1340 1383   rejected the hongwu emperor  s invitation   although he did send some disciples as envoys to the court in nanjing   the hongwu emperor also entrusted his guru zongluo   one of many buddhist monks at court   to head a religious mission into tibet in 1378 1382 in order to obtain buddhist texts

311 however   the early ming government enacted a law   later rescinded   which forbade han chinese to learn the tenets of tibetan buddhism   there is little detailed evidence of chinese especially lay chinese studying tibetan buddhism until the republican era   1912 1949     despite these missions on behalf of the hongwu emperor   morris rossabi writes that the yongle emperor   r  1402 1424      was the first ming ruler actively to seek an extension of relations with tibet

312 according to the official twenty four histories   the history of ming compiled in 1739 by the subsequent qing dynasty   1644 1912     the ming dynasty established the      l  s  army civilian marshal office      chinese              in western tibet and installed the      tsang itinerant high commandery    and    amdo kham itinerant high commandery    to administer kham   the mingshi states that administrative offices were set up under these high commanderies   including one itinerant commandery   three pacification commissioner  s offices   six expedition commissioner  s offices   four wanhu offices   myriarchies   in command of 10 000 households each   and seventeen qianhu offices   chiliarchies   each in command of 1 000 households

313 the ming court appointed three princes of dharma        and five princes         and granted many other titles   such as grand state tutors         and state tutors          to the important schools of tibetan buddhism   including the karma kagyu   sakya   and gelug   according to wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain   leading officials of these organs were all appointed by the central government and were subject to the rule of law   yet van praag describes the distinct and long lasting tibetan law code established by the phagmodru ruler tai situ changchub gyaltsen as one of many reforms to revive old imperial tibetan traditions

314 the late turrell v  wylie   a former professor of the university of washington   and li tieh tseng argue that the reliability of the heavily censored history of ming as a credible source on sino tibetan relations is questionable   in the light of modern scholarship   other historians also assert that these ming titles were nominal and did not actually confer the authority that the earlier yuan titles had   van praag writes that the    numerous economically motivated tibetan missions to the ming court are referred to as  tributary missions   in the ming shih      van praag writes that these    tributary missions    were simply prompted by china  s need for horses from tibet   since a viable horse market in mongol lands was closed as a result of incessant conflict   morris rossabi also writes that    tibet   which had extensive contacts with china during the yuan   scarcely had diplomatic relations with the ming

315 historians disagree on what the relationship was between the ming court and tibet and whether or not ming china had sovereignty over tibet   van praag writes that chinese court historians viewed tibet as an independent foreign tributary and had little interest in tibet besides a lama patron relationship   the historian tsepon w  d  shakabpa supports van praag  s position   however   wang jiawei and nyima gyaincain state that these assertions by van praag and shakabpa are    fallacies

316 wang and nyima argue that the ming emperor sent edicts to tibet twice in the second year of the ming dynasty   and demonstrated that he viewed tibet as a significant region to pacify by urging various tibetan tribes to submit to the authority of the ming court   they note that at the same time   the mongol prince punala   who had inherited his position as ruler of areas of tibet   went to nanjing in 1371 to pay tribute and show his allegiance to the ming court   bringing with him the seal of authority issued by the yuan court   they also state that since successors of lamas granted the title of    prince    had to travel to the ming court to renew this title   and since lamas called themselves princes   the ming court therefore had    full sovereignty over tibet      they state that the ming dynasty   by issuing imperial edicts to invite ex yuan officials to the court for official positions in the early years of its founding   won submission from ex yuan religious and administrative leaders in the tibetan areas   and thereby incorporated tibetan areas into the rule of the ming court   thus   they conclude   the ming court won the power to rule tibetan areas formerly under the rule of the yuan dynasty

317 journalist and author thomas laird   in his book the story of tibet   conversations with the dalai lama   writes that wang and nyima present the government viewpoint of the people  s republic of china in their historical status of china  s tibet   and fail to realize that china was    absorbed into a larger   non chinese political unit    during the mongol yuan dynasty   which wang and nyima paint as a characteristic chinese dynasty succeeded by the ming   laird asserts that the ruling mongol khans never administered tibet as part of china and instead ruled them as separate territories   comparing the mongols with the british who colonized india and new zealand   yet stating this does not make india part of new zealand as a consequence   of later mongol and tibetan accounts interpreting the mongol conquest of tibet   laird asserts that    they   like all non chinese historical narratives   never portray the mongol subjugation of tibet as a chinese one

318 the columbia encyclopedia distinguishes between the yuan dynasty and the other mongol empire khanates of ilkhanate   chagatai khanate and the golden horde   it describes the yuan dynasty as    a mongol dynasty of china that ruled from 1271 to 1368   and a division of the great empire conquered by the mongols   founded by kublai khan   who adopted the chinese dynastic name of y an in 1271      the encyclopedia americana describes the yuan dynasty as    the line of mongol rulers in china    and adds that the mongols    proclaimed a chinese style y an dynasty at khanbaliq   beijing        the metropolitan museum of art writes that the mongol rulers of the yuan dynasty    adopted chinese political and cultural models   ruling from their capitals in dadu   they assumed the role of chinese emperors      although tibetologist thomas laird dismissed the yuan dynasty as a non chinese polity and plays down its chinese characteristics   the metropolitan museum of art also noted that in spite of the gradual assimilation of yuan monarchs   the mongol rulers largely ignored the literati and imposed harsh policies discriminating against southern chinese   in his kublai khan   his life and times   rossabi explains that kublai    created government institutions that either resembled or were the same as the traditional chinese ones      and he    wished to signal to the chinese that he intended to adopt the trappings and style of a chinese ruler

319 nevertheless   the ethno geographic caste hierarchy favoring the mongols and other ethnicities were accorded higher status than the han chinese majority   although han chinese who were recruited as advisers were often actually more influential than high officials   their status was not as well defined   kublai also abolished the imperial examinations of china  s civil service legacy   which was not reinstated until ayurbarwada buyantu khan  s reign   1311 1320     rossabi writes that kublai recognized that in order to rule china      he had to employ chinese advisors and officials   yet he could not rely totally on chinese advisers because he had to maintain a delicate balancing act between ruling the sedentary civilization of china and preserving the cultural identity and values of the mongols      and    in governing china   he was concerned with the interests of his chinese subjects   but also with exploiting the resources of the empire for his own aggrandizement   his motivations and objectives alternated from one to the other throughout his reign      according to rossabi   van praag writes in the status of tibet that the tibetans and mongols   on the other hand   upheld a dual system of rule and an interdependent relationship that legitimated the succession of mongol khans as universal buddhist rulers   or chakravartin   van praag writes that    tibet remained a unique part of the empire and was never fully integrated into it      citing examples such as a licensed border market that existed between china and tibet during the yuan

320 the official position of the ministry of foreign affairs of the people  s republic of china is that the ming implemented a policy of managing tibet according to conventions and customs   granting titles and setting up administrative organs over tibet   the state council information office of the people  s republic states that the ming dynasty  s   tsang commanding office governed most areas of tibet   it also states that while the ming abolished the policy council set up by the mongol yuan to manage local affairs in tibet and the mongol system of imperial tutors to govern religious affairs   the ming adopted a policy of bestowing titles upon religious leaders who had submitted to the ming dynasty   for example   an edict of the hongwu emperor in 1373 appointed the tibetan leader choskunskyabs as the general of the ngari military and civil wanhu office   stating

321 chen qingying   professor of history and director of the history studies institute under the china tibetology research center in beijing   writes that the ming court conferred new official positions on ex yuan tibetan leaders of the phachu kargyu and granted them lower ranking positions   of the county   zong or dzong   leaders of neiwo zong and renbam zong   chen states that when    the emperor learned the actual situation of the phachu kargyu   the ming court then appointed the main zong leaders to be senior officers of the senior command of dbus and gtsang      the official posts that the ming court established in tibet   such as senior and junior commanders   offices of qianhu   in charge of 1 000 households     and offices of wanhu   in charge of 10 000 households     were all hereditary positions according to chen   but he asserts that    the succession of some important posts still had to be approved by the emperor      while old imperial mandates had to be returned to the ming court for renewal

322 according to tibetologist john powers   tibetan sources counter this narrative of titles granted by the chinese to tibetans with various titles which the tibetans gave to the chinese emperors and their officials   tribute missions from tibetan monasteries to the chinese court brought back not only titles   but large   commercially valuable gifts which could subsequently be sold   the ming emperors sent invitations to ruling lamas   but the lamas sent subordinates rather than coming themselves   and no tibetan ruler ever explicitly accepted the role of being a vassal of the ming

324 wang and nyima state that after the official title    education minister    was granted to tai situ changchub gyaltsen   1302 1364   by the yuan court   this title appeared frequently with his name in various tibetan texts   while his tibetan title    degsi      sic properly sde srid or desi   is seldom mentioned   wang and nyima take this to mean that    even in the later period of the yuan dynasty   the yuan imperial court and the phagmodrupa dynasty maintained a central local government relation      the tai situpa is even supposed to have written in his will      in the past i received loving care from the emperor in the east   if the emperor continues to care for us   please follow his edicts and the imperial envoy should be well received

325 however   lok ham chan   a professor of history at the university of washington   writes that changchub gyaltsen  s aims were to recreate the old tibetan kingdom that existed during the chinese tang dynasty   to build    nationalist sentiment    amongst tibetans   and to    remove all traces of mongol suzerainty      georges dreyfus   a professor of religion at williams college   writes that it was changchub gyaltsen who adopted the old administrative system of songts n gampo   c  605 649    the first leader of the tibetan empire to establish tibet as a strong power by reinstating its legal code of punishments and administrative units   for example   instead of the 13 governorships established by the mongol sakya viceroy   changchub gyaltsen divided central tibet into districts   dzong   with district heads   dzong dpon   who had to conform to old rituals and wear clothing styles of old imperial tibet   van praag asserts that changchub gyaltsen  s ambitions were to    restore to tibet the glories of its imperial age    by reinstating secular administration   promoting    national culture and traditions      and installing a law code that survived into the 20th century

326 according to chen   the ming officer of hezhou   modern day linxia   informed the hongwu emperor that the general situation in dbus and gtsang    was under control      and so he suggested to the emperor that he offer the second phagmodru ruler   jamyang shakya gyaltsen   an official title   according to the records of the founding emperor   the hongwu emperor issued an edict granting the title    initiation state master    to sagya gyaincain   while the latter sent envoys to the ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin   statues of the buddha   buddhist scriptures   and sarira

328 the ming dynasty granted titles to lamas of schools such as the karmapa kargyu   but the latter had previously declined mongol invitations to receive titles   when the ming yongle emperor invited je tsongkhapa   1357 1419     founder of the gelug school   to come to the ming court and pay tribute   the latter declined   wang and nyima write that this was due to old age and physical weakness   and also because of efforts being made to build three major monasteries   chen qingying states that tsongkhapa wrote a letter to decline the emperor  s invitation   and in this reply   tsongkhapa wrote

329 a  tom grunfeld says that tsongkhapa claimed ill health in his refusal to appear at the ming court   while rossabi adds that tsongkhapa cited the    length and arduousness of the journey    to china as another reason not to make an appearance   this first request by the ming was made in 1407   but the ming court sent another embassy in 1413   this one led by the eunuch hou xian        fl   1403 1427     which was again refused by tsongkhapa   rossabi writes that tsongkhapa did not want to entirely alienate the ming court   so he sent his disciple chosrje sh kya yeshes to nanjing in 1414 on his behalf   and upon his arrival in 1415 the yongle emperor bestowed upon him the title of    state teacher     the same title earlier awarded the phagmodrupa ruler of tibet   the xuande emperor   r  1425 1435   even granted this disciple chosrje sh kya yeshes the title of a    king            this title does not appear to have held any practical meaning   or to have given its holder any power   at tsongkhapa  s ganden monastery   wylie notes that this like the karma kargyu  can not be seen as a reappointment of mongol yuan offices   since the gelug school was created after the fall of the yuan dynasty

330 dawa norbu argues that modern chinese communist historians tend to be in favor of the view that the ming simply reappointed old yuan dynasty officials in tibet and perpetuated their rule of tibet in this manner   norbu writes that   although this would have been true for the eastern tibetan regions of amdo and kham  s    tribute cum trade    relations with the ming   it was untrue if applied to the western tibetan regions of   tsang and ngari   after the phagmodrupa changchub gyaltsen   these were ruled by    three successive nationalistic regimes      which norbu writes    communist historians prefer to ignore

331 laird writes that the ming appointed titles to eastern tibetan princes   and that    these alliances with eastern tibetan principalities are the evidence china now produces for its assertion that the ming ruled tibet      despite the fact that the ming did not send an army to replace the mongols after they left tibet   yiu yung chin states that the furthest western extent of the ming dynasty  s territory was gansu   sichuan   and yunnan while    the ming did not possess tibet

332 shih shan henry tsai writes that the yongle emperor sent his eunuch yang sanbao into tibet in 1413 to gain the allegiance of various tibetan princes   while the yongle emperor paid a small fortune in return gifts for tributes in order to maintain the loyalty of neighboring vassal states such as nepal and tibet   however   van praag states that tibetan rulers upheld their own separate relations with the kingdoms of nepal and kashmir   and at times    engaged in armed confrontation with them

334 wylie asserts that this type of censorship of the history of ming distorts the true picture of the history of sino tibetan relations   while the ming court granted titles to various lamas regardless of their sectarian affiliations in an ongoing civil war in tibet between competing buddhist factions   wylie argues that ming titles of    king    granted indiscriminately to various tibetan lamas or even their disciples should not be viewed as reappointments to earlier yuan dynasty offices   since the viceregal sakya regime established by the mongols in tibet was overthrown by the phagmodru myriarchy before the ming existed

336 in his usurpation of the throne from the jianwen emperor   r  1398 1402     the yongle emperor was aided by the buddhist monk yao guangxiao   and like his father   the hongwu emperor   the yongle emperor was    well disposed towards buddhism      claims rossabi   on march 10   1403   the yongle emperor invited deshin shekpa   5th karmapa lama   1384 1415     to his court   even though the fourth karmapa had rejected the invitation of the hongwu emperor   a tibetan translation in the 16th century preserves the letter of the yongle emperor   which the association for asian studies notes is polite and complimentary towards the karmapa   the letter of invitation reads

339 throughout the following month   the yongle emperor and his court showered the karmapa with presents   at linggu temple in nanjing   he presided over the religious ceremonies for the yongle emperor  s deceased parents   while twenty two days of his stay were marked by religious miracles that were recorded in five languages on a gigantic scroll that bore the emperor  s seal   during his stay in nanjing   deshin shekpa was bestowed the title    great treasure prince of dharma    by the yongle emperor   elliot sperling asserts that the yongle emperor   in bestowing deshin shekpa with the title of    king    and praising his mystical abilities and miracles   was trying to build an alliance with the karmapa as the mongols had with the sakya lamas   but deshin shekpa rejected the yongle emperor  s offer   in fact   this was the same title that kublai khan had offered the sakya phagpa lama   but deshin shekpa persuaded the yongle emperor to grant the title to religious leaders of other tibetan buddhist sects

340 tibetan sources say deshin shekpa also persuaded the yongle emperor not to impose his military might on tibet as the mongols had previously done   thinley writes that before the karmapa returned to tibet   the yongle emperor began planning to send a military force into tibet to forcibly give the karmapa authority over all the tibetan buddhist schools but deshin shekpa dissuaded him   however   hok lam chan states that    there is little evidence that this was ever the emperor  s intention    and that evidence indicates that deshin skekpa was invited strictly for religious purposes

342 with the example of the ming court  s relationship with the fifth karmapa and other tibetan leaders   norbu states that chinese communist historians have failed to realize the significance of the religious aspect of the ming tibetan relationship   he writes that the meetings of lamas with the emperor of china were exchanges of tribute between    the patron and the priest    and were not merely instances of a political subordinate paying tribute to a superior   he also notes that the items of tribute were buddhist artifacts which symbolized    the religious nature of the relationship      josef kolma  writes that the ming dynasty did not exercise any direct political control over tibet   content with their tribute relations that were    almost entirely of a religious character      patricia ann berger writes that the yongle emperor  s courting and granting of titles to lamas was his attempt to    resurrect the relationship between china and tibet established earlier by the yuan dynastic founder khubilai khan and his guru phagpa      she also writes that the later qing emperors and their mongol associates viewed the yongle emperor  s relationship with tibet as    part of a chain of reincarnation that saw this han chinese emperor as yet another emanation of manjusri

345 tsai writes that shortly after the visit by deshin shekpa   the yongle emperor ordered the construction of a road and of trading posts in the upper reaches of the yangzi and mekong rivers in order to facilitate trade with tibet in tea   horses   and salt   the trade route passed through sichuan and crossed shangri la county in yunnan   wang and nyima assert that this    tribute related trade    of the ming exchanging chinese tea for tibetan horses while granting tibetan envoys and tibetan merchants explicit permission to trade with han chinese merchants     furthered the rule of the ming dynasty court over tibet      rossabi and sperling note that this trade in tibetan horses for chinese tea existed long before the ming   peter c  perdue says that wang anshi   1021 1086     realizing that china could not produce enough militarily capable steeds   had also aimed to obtain horses from inner asia in exchange for chinese tea   the chinese needed horses not only for cavalry but also as draft animals for the army  s supply wagons   the tibetans required chinese tea not only as a common beverage but also as a religious ceremonial supplement   the ming government imposed a monopoly on tea production and attempted to regulate this trade with state supervised markets   but these collapsed in 1449 due to military failures and internal ecological and commercial pressures on the tea producing regions

346 van praag states that the ming court established diplomatic delegations with tibet merely to secure urgently needed horses   wang and nyima argue that these were not diplomatic delegations at all   that tibetan areas were ruled by the ming since tibetan leaders were granted positions as ming officials   that horses were collected from tibet as a mandatory    corv e    tax   and therefore tibetans were    undertaking domestic affairs   not foreign diplomacy      sperling writes that the ming simultaneously bought horses in the kham region while fighting tibetan tribes in amdo and receiving tibetan embassies in nanjing   he also argues that the embassies of tibetan lamas visiting the ming court were for the most part efforts to promote commercial transactions between the lamas   large   wealthy entourage and ming chinese merchants and officials   kolma  writes that while the ming maintained a laissez faire policy towards tibet and limited the numbers of the tibetan retinues   the tibetans sought to maintain a tributary relationship with the ming because imperial patronage provided them with wealth and power   laird writes that tibetans eagerly sought ming court invitations since the gifts the tibetans received for bringing tribute were much greater in value than the latter   as for the yongle emperor  s gifts to his tibetan and nepalese vassals such as silver wares   buddha relics   utensils for buddhist temples and religious ceremonies   and gowns and robes for monks   tsai writes    in his effort to draw neighboring states to the ming orbit so that he could bask in glory   the yongle emperor was quite willing to pay a small price      the information office of the state council of the prc lists the tibetan tribute items as oxen   horses   camels   sheep   fur products   medical herbs   tibetan incenses   thangkas   painted scrolls     and handicrafts   while the ming awarded tibetan tribute bearers an equal value of gold   silver   satin and brocade   bolts of cloth   grains   and tea leaves   silk workshops during the ming also catered specifically to the tibetan market with silk clothes and furnishings featuring tibetan buddhist iconography

347 while the ming dynasty traded horses with tibet   it upheld a policy of outlawing border markets in the north   which laird sees as an effort to punish the mongols for their raids and to    drive them from the frontiers of china      however   after altan khan   1507 1582    leader of the t med mongols who overthrew the oirat mongol confederation  s hegemony over the steppes made peace with the ming dynasty in 1571   he persuaded the ming to reopen their border markets in 1573  this provided the chinese with a new supply of horses that the mongols had in excess   it was also a relief to the ming   since they were unable to stop the mongols from periodic raiding   laird says that despite the fact that later mongols believed altan forced the ming to view him as an equal   chinese historians argue that he was simply a loyal chinese citizen   by 1578   altan khan formed a formidable mongol tibetan alliance with the gelug that the ming viewed from afar without intervention

348 patricia ebrey writes that tibet   like joseon korea and other neighboring states to the ming   settled for its tributary status while there were no troops or governors of ming china stationed in its territory   laird writes that    after the mongol troops left tibet   no ming troops replaced them      wang and nyima state that   despite the fact that the ming refrained from sending troops to subdue tibet and refrained from garrisoning ming troops there   these measures were unnecessary so long as the ming court upheld close ties with tibetan vassals and their forces   however   there were instances in the 14th century when the hongwu emperor did use military force to quell unrest in tibet   john d  langlois writes that there was unrest in tibet and western sichuan   which the marquis mu ying        was commissioned to quell in november 1378 after he established a taozhou garrison in gansu   langlois notes that by october 1379   mu ying had allegedly captured 30 000 tibetan prisoners and 200 000 domesticated animals   yet invasion went both ways   the ming general qu neng   under the command of lan yu   was ordered to repel a tibetan assault into sichuan in 1390

349 discussions of strategy in the mid ming dynasty focused primarily on recovery of the ordos region   which the mongols used as a rallying base to stage raids into ming china   norbu states that the ming dynasty   preoccupied with the mongol threat to the north   could not spare additional armed forces to enforce or back up their claim of sovereignty over tibet   instead   they relied on    confucian instruments of tribute relations    of heaping unlimited number of titles and gifts on tibetan lamas through acts of diplomacy   sperling states that the delicate relationship between the ming and tibet was    the last time a united china had to deal with an independent tibet      that there was a potential for armed conflict at their borders   and that the ultimate goal of ming foreign policy with tibet was not subjugation but    avoidance of any kind of tibetan threat      p  christiaan klieger argues that the ming court  s patronage of high tibetan lamas    was designed to help stabilize border regions and protect trade routes

350 historians luciano petech and sato hisashi argue that the ming upheld a    divide and rule    policy towards a weak and politically fragmented tibet after the sakya regime had fallen   chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the yongle emperor   as exclusive patronage to one tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power   sperling finds no textual evidence in either chinese or tibetan sources to support this thesis of petech and hisashi   norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of ming titles conferred on tibetan lamas rather than    comparative analysis of developments in china and tibet      rossabi states that this theory    attributes too much influence to the chinese      pointing out that tibet was already politically divided when the ming dynasty began   rossabi also discounts the    divide and rule    theory on the grounds of the yongle emperor  s failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth karmapa one which he hoped would parallel kublai khan  s earlier relationship with the sakya phagpa lama   instead   the yongle emperor followed the karmapa  s advice of giving patronage to many different tibetan lamas

352 the zhengde emperor   r  1505 1521     who enjoyed the company of lamas at court despite protests from the censorate   had heard tales of a    living buddha    which he desired to host at the ming capital   this was none other than the rinpung supported miky  dorje   8th karmapa lama then occupying lhasa   zhengde  s top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from inviting this lama to court   arguing that tibetan buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox   despite protests by the grand secretary liang chu   in 1515 the zhengde emperor sent his eunuch official liu yun of the palace chancellery on a mission to invite this karmapa to beijing   liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the yangtze   consuming 2 835 g   100 oz   of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in chengdu of sichuan   after procurring necessary gifts for the mission   he departed with a cavalry force of about 1 000 troops   when the request was delivered   the karmapa lama refused to leave tibet despite the ming force brought to coerce him   the karmapa launched a surprise ambush on liu yun  s camp   seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of liu yun  s entire escort   after this fiasco   liu fled for his life   but only returned to chengdu several years later to find that the zhengde emperor had died

353 elliot sperling   a specialist of indian studies and the director of the tibetan studies program at indiana university s department of central eurasia studies   writes that    the idea that tibet became part of china in the 13th century is a very recent construction      he writes that chinese writers of the early 20th century were of the view that tibet was not annexed by china until the manchu qing dynasty invasion during the 18th century   he also states that chinese writers of the early 20th century described tibet as a feudal dependency of china   not an integral part of it   sperling states that this is because    tibet was ruled as such   within the empires of the mongols and the manchus    and also that    china  s intervening ming dynasty     had no control over tibet      he writes that the ming relationship with tibet is problematic for china s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over tibet since the 13th century   as for the tibetan view that tibet was never subject to the rule of the yuan or qing emperors of china   sperling also discounts this by stating that tibet was    subject to rules   laws and decisions made by the yuan and qing rulers    and that even tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors

381 the third generation ipod had a weak bass response   as shown in audio tests   the combination of the undersized dc blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high pass filter   which attenuates the low frequency bass output   similar capacitors were used in the fourth generation ipods   the problem is reduced when using high impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high impedance   line level   loads   such as an external headphone amplifier   the first generation ipod shuffle uses a dual transistor output stage   rather than a single capacitor coupled output   and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load

382 for all ipods released in 2006 and earlier   some equalizer   eq   sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily   even on undemanding songs   this would happen for eq settings like r   b   rock   acoustic   and bass booster   because the equalizer amplified the digital audio level beyond the software  s limit   causing distortion   clipping   on bass instruments

385 the third generation began including a 30 pin dock connector   allowing for firewire or usb connectivity   this provided better compatibility with non apple machines   as most of them did not have firewire ports at the time   eventually apple began shipping ipods with usb cables instead of firewire   although the latter was available separately   as of the first generation ipod nano and the fifth generation ipod classic   apple discontinued using firewire for data transfer   while still allowing for use of firewire to charge the device   in an attempt to reduce cost and form factor   as of the second generation ipod touch and the fourth generation ipod nano   firewire charging ability has been removed   the second    third    and fourth generation ipod shuffle uses a single 3 5 mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack and a data port for the dock

443 in 2003   nintendo announced that a new the legend of zelda game was in the works for the gamecube by the same team that had created the cel shaded the wind waker   at the following year  s game developers conference   director eiji aonuma unintentionally revealed that the game  s sequel was in development under the working title the wind waker 2   it was set to use a similar graphical style to that of its predecessor   nintendo of america told aonuma that north american sales of the wind waker were sluggish because its cartoon appearance created the impression that the game was designed for a young audience   concerned that the sequel would have the same problem   aonuma expressed to producer shigeru miyamoto that he wanted to create a realistic zelda game that would appeal to the north american market   miyamoto   hesitant about solely changing the game  s presentation   suggested the team  s focus should instead be on coming up with gameplay innovations   he advised that aonuma should start by doing what could not be done in ocarina of time   particularly horseback combat     l

445 prior zelda games have employed a theme of two separate   yet connected   worlds   in a link to the past   link travels between a    light world    and a    dark world      in ocarina of time   as well as in oracle of ages   link travels between two different time periods   the zelda team sought to reuse this motif in the series   latest installment   it was suggested that link transform into a wolf   much like he metamorphoses into a rabbit in the dark world of a link to the past     m   the story of the game was created by aonuma   and later underwent several changes by scenario writers mitsuhiro takano and aya kyogoku   takano created the script for the story scenes   while kyogoku and takayuki ikkaku handled the actual in game script   aonuma left his team working on the new idea while he directed the minish cap for the game boy advance   when he returned   he found the twilight princess team struggling   emphasis on the parallel worlds and the wolf transformation had made link  s character unbelievable   aonuma also felt the gameplay lacked the caliber of innovation found in phantom hourglass   which was being developed with touch controls for the nintendo ds   at the same time   the wii was under development with the code name    revolution      miyamoto thought that the revolution  s pointing device   the wii remote   was well suited for aiming arrows in zelda   and suggested that aonuma consider using it     n

446 aonuma had anticipated creating a zelda game for what would later be called the wii   but had assumed that he would need to complete twilight princess first   his team began work developing a pointing based interface for the bow and arrow   and aonuma found that aiming directly at the screen gave the game a new feel   just like the ds control scheme for phantom hourglass   aonuma felt confident this was the only way to proceed   but worried about consumers who had been anticipating a gamecube release   developing two versions would mean delaying the previously announced 2005 release   still disappointing the consumer   satoru iwata felt that having both versions would satisfy users in the end   even though they would have to wait for the finished product   aonuma then started working on both versions in parallel     o

744 the origin of tom robinson is less clear   although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models   when lee was 10 years old   a white woman near monroeville accused a black man named walter lett of raping her   the story and the trial were covered by her father  s newspaper which reported that lett was convicted and sentenced to death   after a series of letters appeared claiming lett had been falsely accused   his sentence was commuted to life in prison   he died there of tuberculosis in 1937  scholars believe that robinson  s difficulties reflect the notorious case of the scottsboro boys   in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence   however   in 2005   lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational   although the scottsboro case served    the same purpose    to display southern prejudices   emmett till   a black teenager who was murdered for flirting with a white woman in mississippi in 1955   and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the civil rights movement   is also considered a model for tom robinson

745 writing about lee  s style and use of humor in a tragic story   scholar jacqueline tavernier courbin states      laughter       exposes   the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it   one can hardly     be controlled by what one is able to laugh at      scout  s precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspire national endowment of the arts director david kipen to call her    hysterically funny      to address complex issues   however   tavernier courbin notes that lee uses parody   satire   and irony effectively by using a child  s perspective   after dill promises to marry her   then spends too much time with jem   scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up   which she does several times   scout  s first day in school is a satirical treatment of education   her teacher says she must undo the damage atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write   and forbids atticus from teaching her further   lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony   however   as jem and scout try to understand how maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society   satire and irony are used to such an extent that tavernier courbin suggests one interpretation for the book  s title   lee is doing the mocking of education   the justice system   and her own society by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval

746 critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot   when atticus is out of town   jem locks a sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of shadrach   this prompts their black housekeeper calpurnia to escort scout and jem to her church   which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life   as well as tom robinson  s   scout falls asleep during the halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage   causing the audience to laugh uproariously   she is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume   which saves her life

747 scholars have characterized to kill a mockingbird as both a southern gothic and coming of age or bildungsroman novel   the grotesque and near supernatural qualities of boo radley and his house   and the element of racial injustice involving tom robinson contribute to the aura of the gothic in the novel   lee used the term    gothic    to describe the architecture of maycomb  s courthouse and in regard to dill  s exaggeratedly morbid performances as boo radley   outsiders are also an important element of southern gothic texts and scout and jem  s questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to catcher in the rye and adventures of huckleberry finn   despite challenging the town  s systems   scout reveres atticus as an authority above all others   because he believes that following one  s conscience is the highest priority   even when the result is social ostracism   however   scholars debate about the southern gothic classification   noting that boo radley is in fact human   protective   and benevolent   furthermore   in addressing themes such as alcoholism   incest   rape   and racial violence   lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically   she portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society

748 as children coming of age   scout and jem face hard realities and learn from them   lee seems to examine jem  s sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than scout  s   jem says to their neighbor miss maudie the day after the trial      it  s like bein   a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon     i always thought maycomb folks were the best folks in the world   least that  s what they seemed like      this leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class   just as the novel is an illustration of the changes jem faces   it is also an exploration of the realities scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood   as one scholar writes      to kill a mockingbird can be read as a feminist bildungsroman   for scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be

749 the second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer harding lemay termed    the spirit corroding shame of the civilized white southerner in the treatment of the negro      in the years following its release   many reviewers considered to kill a mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations   claudia durst johnson considers it    reasonable to believe    that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in alabama   rosa parks   refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person   which sparked the 1955 montgomery bus boycott   and the 1956 riots at the university of alabama after autherine lucy and polly myers were admitted   myers eventually withdrew her application and lucy was expelled   but reinstated in 1980     in writing about the historical context of the novel  s construction   two other literary scholars remark      to kill a mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict ridden social change in the south since the civil war and reconstruction   inevitably   despite its mid 1930s setting   the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts   tensions   and fears induced by this transition

750 scholar patrick chura   who suggests emmett till was a model for tom robinson   enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional tom that till also faced   chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the    mythologized vulnerable and sacred southern womanhood      any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused   tom robinson  s trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence   as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury  s decision   furthermore   the victim of racial injustice in to kill a mockingbird was physically impaired   which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of   but also crippled him in other ways   roslyn siegel includes tom robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white southern writers of the black man as    stupid   pathetic   defenseless   and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites   rather than his own intelligence to save him      although tom is spared from being lynched   he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison   shot seventeen times

751 the theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well   for example   atticus must shoot a rabid dog   even though it is not his job to do so   carolyn jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of maycomb   and atticus   who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog   must fight against the town  s racism without help from other white citizens   he is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch tom robinson and once more in the courthouse during tom  s trial   lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes   jones writes        t   he real mad dog in maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of tom robinson       when atticus makes his summation to the jury   he literally bares himself to the jury  s and the town  s anger

752 in a 1964 interview   lee remarked that her aspiration was    to be     the jane austen of south alabama      both austen and lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing   when scout embarrasses her poorer classmate   walter cunningham   at the finch home one day   calpurnia   their black cook   chastises and punishes her for doing so   atticus respects calpurnia  s judgment   and later in the book even stands up to his sister   the formidable aunt alexandra   when she strongly suggests they fire calpurnia   one writer notes that scout      in austenian fashion      satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify   literary critic jean blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors      affirmation of order in society   obedience   courtesy   and respect for the individual without regard for status

753 scholars argue that lee  s approach to class and race was more complex    than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to  poor white trash       lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice   silence the voices that might challenge the existing order   and greatly complicate many americans   conception of the causes of racism and segregation      lee  s use of the middle class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader   regardless of class or cultural background   and fosters a sense of nostalgia   sharing scout and jem  s perspective   the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum mrs  dubose   the lower class ewells   and the cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways   the wealthy but ostracized mr  dolphus raymond   and calpurnia and other members of the black community   the children internalize atticus   admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person  s skin   gaining a greater understanding of people  s motives and behavior

754 the novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage   scout  s impulsive inclination to fight students who insult atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him   atticus is the moral center of the novel   however   and he teaches jem one of the most significant lessons of courage   in a statement that foreshadows atticus   motivation for defending tom robinson and describes mrs  dubose   who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction   atticus tells jem that courage is    when you  re licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what

755 charles shields   who has written the only book length biography of harper lee to date   offers the reason for the novel  s enduring popularity and impact is that    its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal      atticus   lesson to scout that    you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it    exemplifies his compassion   she ponders the comment when listening to mayella ewell  s testimony   when mayella reacts with confusion to atticus   question if she has any friends   scout offers that she must be lonelier than boo radley   having walked boo home after he saves their lives   scout stands on the radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from boo  s perspective   one writer remarks            w   hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice   heartache and loss   it also carries with it a strong sense   of   courage   compassion   and an awareness of history to be better human beings

756 just as lee explores jem  s development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society   scout realizes what being female means   and several female characters influence her development   scout  s primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider   scout  s primary female models are calpurnia and her neighbor miss maudie   both of whom are strong willed   independent   and protective   mayella ewell also has an influence   scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him   the female characters who comment the most on scout  s lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view   for example   mrs  dubose chastises scout for not wearing a dress and camisole   and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so   in addition to insulting atticus   intentions to defend tom robinson   by balancing the masculine influences of atticus and jem with the feminine influences of calpurnia and miss maudie   one scholar writes      lee gradually demonstrates that scout is becoming a feminist in the south   for with the use of first person narration   she indicates that scout  jean louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a southern lady she possessed as a child

757 absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel   scout and jem  s mother died before scout could remember her   mayella  s mother is dead   and mrs  radley is silent about boo  s confinement to the house   apart from atticus   the fathers described are abusers   bob ewell   it is hinted   molested his daughter   and mr  radley imprisons his son in his house until boo is remembered only as a phantom   bob ewell and mr  radley represent a form of masculinity that atticus does not   and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the missionary society can lead society astray   atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity   as one scholar explains      it is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism   bravery   and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality   to set the society straight

758 allusions to legal issues in to kill a mockingbird   particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom   has drawn the attention from legal scholars   claudia durst johnson writes that    a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals      the opening quote by the 19th century essayist charles lamb reads      lawyers   i suppose   were children once      johnson notes that even in scout and jem  s childhood world   compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one  s palm and laws are discussed by atticus and his children   is it right that bob ewell hunts and traps out of season   many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms   mr  dolphus raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common law wife and having interracial children   mayella ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing tom robinson   by being turned into a non person   boo radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him   scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them   for example   she refuses to wear frilly clothes   saying that aunt alexandra  s    fanatical    attempts to place her in them made her feel    a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on   her        johnson states        t   he novel is a study of how jem and scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of   their   small worlds

759 songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel   the family  s last name of finch also shares lee  s mother  s maiden name   the titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme   which first appears when atticus   having given his children air rifles for christmas   allows their uncle jack to teach them to shoot   atticus warns them that   although they can    shoot all the bluejays they want      they must remember that    it  s a sin to kill a mockingbird      confused   scout approaches her neighbor miss maudie   who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures   she points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs   saying      they do n t do one thing but sing their hearts out for us      writer edwin bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964       to kill a mockingbird   is to kill that which is innocent and harmless like tom robinson      scholars have noted that lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point

777 an earlier draft of to kill a mockingbird   titled go set a watchman   was controversially released on july 14   2015  this draft   which was completed in 1957   is set 20 years after the time period depicted in to kill a mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative   this earlier version of the story follows an adult scout finch who travels from new york to visit her father   atticus finch   in maycomb   alabama   where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community   the watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until lee  s lawyer tonja carter discovered it   although this claim has been widely disputed   watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from to kill a mockingbird   according to lee  s agent andrew nurnberg   mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy      they discussed publishing mockingbird first   watchman last   and a shorter connecting novel between the two      this assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert james s  jaffe   who reviewed the pages at the request of lee  s attorney and found them to be only another draft of    to kill a mockingbird      the statement was also contrary to jonathan mahler  s description of how    watchman    was seen as just the first draft of    mockingbird      instances where many passages overlap between the two books   in some case word for word   also refutes this assertion

778 the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor   despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality   the narrator  s father   atticus finch   has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers   one critic explains the novel  s impact by writing      in the twentieth century   to kill a mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in america   and its protagonist   atticus finch   the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism

779 the strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is lee  s talent for narration   which in an early review in time was called    tactile brilliance      writing a decade later   another scholar noted      harper lee has a remarkable gift of story telling   her art is visual   and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition      lee combines the narrator  s voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman  s reflecting on her childhood   using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives   this narrative method allows lee to tell a    delightfully deceptive    story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition   however   at times the blending causes reviewers to question scout  s preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding   both harding lemay and the novelist and literary critic granville hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as scout and jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for tom robinson  s life
what is lee  s strongest style of writing	narration	15	15
780 harper lee has remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid 1960s   however   she gave some insight into her themes when   in a rare letter to the editor   she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused      surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that to kill a mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct   christian in its ethic   that is the heritage of all southerners
according to lee   her book simply expressed a christian code of honor and conduct inherit to whom	all southerners	79	80
781 when the book was released   reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts   and opinion was mixed about lee  s ability to connect them   the first part of the novel concerns the children  s fascination with boo radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood   reviewers were generally charmed by scout and jem  s observations of their quirky neighbors   one writer was so impressed by lee  s detailed explanations of the people of maycomb that he categorized the book as southern romantic regionalism   this sentimentalism can be seen in lee  s representation of the southern caste system to explain almost every character  s behavior in the novel   scout  s aunt alexandra attributes maycomb  s inhabitants   faults and advantages to genealogy   families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks     and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the finch family history and the history of maycomb   this regionalist theme is further reflected in mayella ewell  s apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward tom robinson   and scout  s definition of    fine folks    being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have   the south itself   with its traditions and taboos   seems to drive the plot more than the characters
besides the children  s fascination with boo   the first part of the book was concerned about their feelings for what	the neighborhood	47	48
782 tom robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel   however   scholar christopher metress connects the mockingbird to boo radley      instead of wanting to exploit boo for her own fun   as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history     scout comes to see him as a  mockingbird  that is   as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished      the last pages of the book illustrate this as scout relates the moral of a story atticus has been reading to her   and in allusions to both boo radley and tom robinson states about a character who was misunderstood      when they finally saw him   why he had n t done any of those things     atticus   he was real nice      to which he responds      most people are   scout   when you finally see them
who is the main example of an innocent destroyed in the novel	tom robinson	0	1
783 the novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer r  a  dave claims that because every character has to face   or even suffer defeat   the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy   in exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat   lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools   she guides the reader in such judgments   alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony   scout  s experience with the missionary society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her   gossip   and    reflect a smug   colonialist attitude toward other races    while giving the    appearance of gentility   piety   and morality      conversely   when atticus loses tom  s case   he is last to leave the courtroom   except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony   who rise silently as he walks underneath them   to honor his efforts
reviewer r  a  dave classified the novel how	classical tragedy	33	34
784 initial reactions to the novel were varied   the new yorker declared it    skilled   unpretentious   and totally ingenious      and the atlantic monthly  s reviewer rated it as    pleasant   undemanding reading      but found the narrative voice     a six year old girl with the prose style of a well educated adult     to be implausible   time magazine  s 1960 review of the book states that it    teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about southern life    and calls scout finch    the most appealing child since carson mccullers   frankie got left behind at the wedding      the chicago sunday tribune noted the even handed approach to the narration of the novel  s events   writing      this is in no way a sociological novel   it underlines no cause     to kill a mockingbird is a novel of strong contemporary national significance

785 not all reviewers were enthusiastic   some lamented the use of poor white southerners   and one dimensional black victims   and granville hicks labeled the book    melodramatic and contrived      when the book was first released   southern writer flannery o connor commented      i think for a child  s book it does all right   it  s interesting that all the folks that are buying it do n t know they  re reading a child  s book   somebody ought to say what it is      carson mccullers apparently agreed with the time magazine review   writing to a cousin      well   honey   one thing we know is that she  s been poaching on my literary preserves

786 the 50th anniversary of the novel  s release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact   eric zorn of the chicago tribune praises lee  s    rich use of language    but writes that the central lesson is that    courage is n t always flashy   is n t always enough   but is always in style      jane sullivan in the sydney morning herald agrees   stating that the book    still rouses fresh and horrified indignation    as it examines morality   a topic that has recently become unfashionable   chimamanda ngozi adichie writing in the guardian states that lee   rare among american novelists   writes with    a fiercely progressive ink   in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question      comparing her to william faulkner   who wrote about racism as an inevitability   literary critic rosemary goring in scotland  s the herald notes the connections between lee and jane austen   stating the book  s central theme   that    one s moral convictions are worth fighting for   even at the risk of being reviled    is eloquently discussed

787 native alabamian allen barra sharply criticized lee and the novel in the wall street journal calling atticus a    repository of cracker barrel epigrams    and the novel represents a    sugar coated myth    of alabama history   barra writes      it  s time to stop pretending that to kill a mockingbird is some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of american literature   its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated      thomas mallon in the new yorker criticizes atticus   stiff and self righteous demeanor   and calls scout    a kind of highly constructed doll    whose speech and actions are improbable   although acknowledging that the novel works   mallon blasts lee  s    wildly unstable    narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama   following with his observation that    the book has begun to cherish its own goodness    by the time the case is over     note 2   defending the book   akin ajayi writes that justice    is often complicated   but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all      ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race   class   and society   but that it was not written to resolve them

788 furthermore   despite the novel  s thematic focus on racial injustice   its black characters are not fully examined   in its use of racial epithets   stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks   and calpurnia   who to some critics is an updated version of the    contented slave    motif and to others simply unexplored   the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters   one writer asserts that the use of scout  s narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict   scout  s voice    functions as the not me which allows the rest of us black and white   male and female to find our relative position in society      a teaching guide for the novel published by the english journal cautions      what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another      a canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students   but that black students found it    demoralizing      another criticism   articulated by michael lind   is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural    white trash

789 diane mcwhorter   pulitzer prize winning historian of the birmingham civil rights campaign   asserts that to kill a mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists   and states that every child in the south has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality   this feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised   which for many children is what the novel does   mcwhorter writes of lee      for a white person from the south to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual by its very existence an act of protest        note 4   author james mcbride calls lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave      i think by calling harper lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism     she certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed   but in many ways i feel     the moral bar  s been lowered   and that  s really distressing   we need a thousand atticus finches      mcbride   however   defends the book  s sentimentality   and the way lee approaches the story with    honesty and integrity
according to diane mcwhorter   every child in the south had to face what	the harsh reality of inequality	42	46
790 according to a national geographic article   the novel is so revered in monroeville that people quote lines from it like scripture   yet harper lee herself refused to attend any performances   because    she abhors anything that trades on the book  s fame      to underscore this sentiment   lee demanded that a book of recipes named calpurnia  s cookbook not be published and sold out of the monroe county heritage museum   david lister in the independent states that lee  s refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more   and her silence    makes bob dylan look like a media tart      despite her discouragement   a rising number of tourists made to monroeville a destination   hoping to see lee  s inspiration for the book   or lee herself   local residents call them    mockingbird groupies      and although lee was not reclusive   she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic    hell   no

834 the potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography   time variation   cloud cover   and the land available to humans limits the amount of solar energy that we can acquire
why does the amount of usable solar energy differ from the amount near the planets surface	geography   time variation   cloud cover   and the land available to humans	28	38
835 geography effects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation   however   the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator   time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the earth for solar panels to absorb   this limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day   cloud cover can effect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells
why does geography have an effect of the amount of solar energy available	areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation	6	19
836 in addition   land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is unowned and suitable for solar panels   roofs have been found to be a suitable place for solar cells   as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way   other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are unowned by businesses where solar plants can be established

1127 mahayana buddhism received significant theoretical grounding from nagarjuna   perhaps c  150 250 ce     arguably the most influential scholar within the mahayana tradition   nagarjuna  s primary contribution to buddhist philosophy was the systematic exposition of the concept of   nyat    or    emptiness      widely attested in the praj  p ramit  sutras that emerged in his era   the concept of emptiness brings together other key buddhist doctrines   particularly anatta and dependent origination   to refute the metaphysics of sarvastivada and sautrantika   extinct non mahayana schools     for nagarjuna   it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of  tman   all phenomena   dharmas   are without any svabhava   literally    own nature    or    self nature        and thus without any underlying essence   they are    empty    of being independent   thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early buddhism   nagarjuna  s school of thought is known as the m dhyamaka   some of the writings attributed to nagarjuna made explicit references to mahayana texts   but his philosophy was argued within the parameters set out by the agamas   he may have arrived at his positions from a desire to achieve a consistent exegesis of the buddha  s doctrine as recorded in the canon   in the eyes of nagarjuna the buddha was not merely a forerunner   but the very founder of the m dhyamaka system

1129 besides emptiness   mahayana schools often place emphasis on the notions of perfected spiritual insight   praj  p ramit    and buddha nature   tath gatagarbha     there are conflicting interpretations of the tath gatagarbha in mah y na thought   the idea may be traced to abhidharma   and ultimately to statements of the buddha in the nik yas   in tibetan buddhism   according to the sakya school   tath gatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one  s mind   in nyingma   tath gatagarbha also generally refers to inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one  s mind   according to the gelug school   it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they are empty   i e   dependently originated     according to the jonang school   it refers to the innate qualities of the mind that expresses themselves as omniscience etc   when adventitious obscurations are removed   the    tath gatagarbha sutras    are a collection of mahayana sutras that present a unique model of buddha nature   even though this collection was generally ignored in india   east asian buddhism provides some significance to these texts

1157 la is the foundation of sam dhi bh vana   meditative cultivation   or mind cultivation   keeping the precepts promotes not only the peace of mind of the cultivator   which is internal   but also peace in the community   which is external   according to the law of karma   keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects   keeping these precepts keeps the cultivator from rebirth in the four woeful realms of existence

1159 the precepts are not formulated as imperatives   but as training rules that laypeople undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice   in buddhist thought   the cultivation of dana and ethical conduct themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely   even if there is no further buddhist practice   there is nothing improper or un buddhist about limiting one  s aims to this level of attainment

1164 in eastern buddhism   there is also a distinctive vinaya and ethics contained within the mahayana brahmajala sutra   not to be confused with the pali text of that name   for bodhisattvas   where   for example   the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged   see vegetarianism in buddhism     in japan   this has almost completely displaced the monastic vinaya   and allows clergy to marry

1165 buddhist meditation is fundamentally concerned with two themes   transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena   according to theravada buddhism the buddha taught two types of meditation   samatha meditation   sanskrit    amatha   and vipassan  meditation   sanskrit   vipa yan      in chinese buddhism   these exist   translated chih kuan     but ch n   zen   meditation is more popular   according to peter harvey   whenever buddhism has been healthy   not only monks   nuns   and married lamas   but also more committed lay people have practiced meditation   according to routledge  s encyclopedia of buddhism   in contrast   throughout most of buddhist history before modern times   serious meditation by lay people has been unusual   the evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the buddha   many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation   some even to the point of proficiency in all eight jh nas   see the next section regarding these       note 11

1166 in the language of the noble eightfold path   samyaksam dhi is    right concentration      the primary means of cultivating sam dhi is meditation   upon development of sam dhi   one  s mind becomes purified of defilement   calm   tranquil   and luminous

1167 once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration   jh na   sanskrit       dhy na     his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight   vipassan    into the ultimate nature of reality   eventually obtaining release from all suffering   the cultivation of mindfulness is essential to mental concentration   which is needed to achieve insight

1168 samatha meditation starts from being mindful of an object or idea   which is expanded to one  s body   mind and entire surroundings   leading to a state of total concentration and tranquility   jh na     there are many variations in the style of meditation   from sitting cross legged or kneeling to chanting or walking   the most common method of meditation is to concentrate on one  s breath   anapanasati     because this practice can lead to both samatha and vipassana

1169 in buddhist practice   it is said that while samatha meditation can calm the mind   only vipassan  meditation can reveal how the mind was disturbed to start with   which is what leads to insight knowledge   j  na   p li    a   and understanding   praj   p li pa        and thus can lead to nirv  a   p li nibb na     when one is in jhana   all defilements are suppressed temporarily   only understanding   praj   or vipassana   eradicates the defilements completely   jhanas are also states that arahants abide in order to rest

1170 in therav da buddhism   the cause of human existence and suffering is identified as craving   which carries with it the various defilements   these various defilements are traditionally summed up as greed   hatred and delusion   these are believed deeply rooted afflictions of the mind that create suffering and stress   to be free from suffering and stress   these defilements must be permanently uprooted through internal investigation   analyzing   experiencing   and understanding of the true nature of those defilements by using jh na   a technique of the noble eightfold path   it then leads the meditator to realize the four noble truths   enlightenment and nibb na   nibb na is the ultimate goal of theravadins

1171 praj     sanskrit   or pa      p li   means wisdom that is based on a realization of dependent origination   the four noble truths and the three marks of existence   praj   is the wisdom that is able to extinguish afflictions and bring about bodhi   it is spoken of as the principal means of attaining nirv  a   through its revelation of the true nature of all things as dukkha   unsatisfactoriness     anicca   impermanence   and anatta   not self     praj   is also listed as the sixth of the six p ramit s of the mahayana

1172 initially   praj   is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons   dharma talks     reading   studying   and sometimes reciting buddhist texts and engaging in discourse   once the conceptual understanding is attained   it is applied to daily life so that each buddhist can verify the truth of the buddha  s teaching at a practical level   notably   one could in theory attain nirvana at any point of practice   whether deep in meditation   listening to a sermon   conducting the business of one  s daily life   or any other activity

1173 zen buddhism         pronounced ch n in chinese   seon in korean or zen in japanese   derived from the sanskrit term dhy na   meaning    meditation      is a form of buddhism that became popular in china   korea and japan and that lays special emphasis on meditation     note 12   zen places less emphasis on scriptures than some other forms of buddhism and prefers to focus on direct spiritual breakthroughs to truth

1175 zen buddhist teaching is often full of paradox   in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the true self or formless self   which is equated with the buddha himself     note 14   according to zen master kosho uchiyama   when thoughts and fixation on the little    i    are transcended   an awakening to a universal   non dual self occurs      when we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them   we discover the self that is living universal non dual life   before the separation into two   that pervades all living creatures and all existence      thinking and thought must therefore not be allowed to confine and bind one

1177 historically   the roots of buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient india during the second half of the first millennium bce   that was a period of social and religious turmoil   as there was significant discontent with the sacrifices and rituals of vedic brahmanism     note 15   it was challenged by numerous new ascetic religious and philosophical groups and teachings that broke with the brahmanic tradition and rejected the authority of the vedas and the brahmans     note 16   these groups   whose members were known as shramanas   were a continuation of a non vedic strand of indian thought distinct from indo aryan brahmanism     note 17   scholars have reasons to believe that ideas such as samsara   karma   in the sense of the influence of morality on rebirth     and moksha originated in the shramanas   and were later adopted by brahmin orthodoxy     note 18     note 19     note 20     note 21     note 22     note 23

1178 this view is supported by a study of the region where these notions originated   buddhism arose in greater magadha   which stretched from sravasti   the capital of kosala in the north west   to rajagrha in the south east   this land   to the east of aryavarta   the land of the aryas   was recognized as non vedic   other vedic texts reveal a dislike of the people of magadha   in all probability because the magadhas at this time were not brahmanised     page needed   it was not until the 2nd or 3rd centuries bce that the eastward spread of brahmanism into greater magadha became significant   ideas that developed in greater magadha prior to this were not subject to vedic influence   these include rebirth and karmic retribution that appear in a number of movements in greater magadha   including buddhism   these movements inherited notions of rebirth and karmic retribution from an earlier culture   page needed

1179 at the same time   these movements were influenced by   and in some respects continued   philosophical thought within the vedic tradition as reflected e g   in the upanishads   these movements included   besides buddhism   various skeptics   such as sanjaya belatthiputta     atomists   such as pakudha kaccayana     materialists   such as ajita kesakambali     antinomians   such as purana kassapa     the most important ones in the 5th century bce were the ajivikas   who emphasized the rule of fate   the lokayata   materialists     the ajnanas   agnostics   and the jains   who stressed that the soul must be freed from matter   many of these new movements shared the same conceptual vocabulary atman      self        buddha      awakened one        dhamma      rule    or    law        karma      action        nirvana      extinguishing        samsara      eternal recurrence      and yoga      spiritual practice          note 24   the shramanas rejected the veda   and the authority of the brahmans   who claimed they possessed revealed truths not knowable by any ordinary human means   moreover   they declared that the entire brahmanical system was fraudulent   a conspiracy of the brahmans to enrich themselves by charging exorbitant fees to perform bogus rites and give useless advice

1180 a particular criticism of the buddha was vedic animal sacrifice     web 18   he also mocked the vedic    hymn of the cosmic man      however   the buddha was not anti vedic   and declared that the veda in its true form was declared by    kashyapa    to certain rishis   who by severe penances had acquired the power to see by divine eyes   he names the vedic rishis   and declared that the original veda of the rishis   note 25   was altered by a few brahmins who introduced animal sacrifices   the buddha says that it was on this alteration of the true veda that he refused to pay respect to the vedas of his time   however   he did not denounce the union with brahman     note 26   or the idea of the self uniting with the self   at the same time   the traditional hindu itself gradually underwent profound changes   transforming it into what is recognized as early hinduism

1181 information of the oldest teachings may be obtained by analysis of the oldest texts   one method to obtain information on the oldest core of buddhism is to compare the oldest extant versions of the theravadin pali canon and other texts     note 27   the reliability of these sources   and the possibility to draw out a core of oldest teachings   is a matter of dispute     page needed     page needed     page needed     page needed   according to vetter   inconsistencies remain   and other methods must be applied to resolve those inconsistencies     note 28

1182 a core problem in the study of early buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight   schmithausen   in his often cited article on some aspects of descriptions or theories of  liberating insight   and  enlightenment   in early buddhism notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting    liberating insight      which is attained after mastering the rupa jhanas   is a later addition to texts such as majjhima nikaya 36     page needed

1183 bruce matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the sutta pitaka   which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early buddhist soteriology   schmithausen is a notable scholar who has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest buddhism     page needed     note 32   according to vetter      the buddha at first sought    the deathless      amata amrta     which is concerned with the here and now   according to vetter   only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth      bronkhorst disagrees   and concludes that the buddha    introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time      according to bronkhorst   not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth   but intentions and desire
according the bronkhorst   intentions and desire are responsible for what	rebirth	49	49
1184 according to tilmann vetter   the core of earliest buddhism is the practice of dhy na   bronkhorst agrees that dhyana was a buddhist invention   whereas norman notes that    the buddha  s way to release         was by means of meditative practices      discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development

1188 according to both bronkhorst and anderson   the four truths became a substitution for prajna   or    liberating insight      in the suttas in those texts where    liberating insight    was preceded by the four jhanas   according to bronkhorst   the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest buddhism   and did not serve in earliest buddhism as a description of    liberating insight      gotama  s teachings may have been personal      adjusted to the need of each person

1190 the history of indian buddhism may be divided into five periods   early buddhism   occasionally called pre sectarian buddhism     nikaya buddhism or sectarian buddhism   the period of the early buddhist schools   early mahayana buddhism   later mahayana buddhism   and esoteric buddhism   also called vajrayana buddhism

1191 pre sectarian buddhism is the earliest phase of buddhism   recognized by nearly all scholars   its main scriptures are the vinaya pitaka and the four principal nikayas or agamas   certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts   so most scholars conclude that gautama buddha must have taught something similar to the three marks of existence   the five aggregates   dependent origination   karma and rebirth   the four noble truths   the noble eightfold path   and nirvana   some scholars disagree   and have proposed many other theories

1192 according to the scriptures   soon after the parinirv  a   from sanskrit      highest extinguishment      of gautama buddha   the first buddhist council was held   as with any ancient indian tradition   transmission of teaching was done orally   the primary purpose of the assembly was to collectively recite the teachings to ensure that no errors occurred in oral transmission   in the first council    nanda   a cousin of the buddha and his personal attendant   was called upon to recite the discourses   s tras   p li suttas   of the buddha   and   according to some sources   the abhidhamma   up li   another disciple   recited the monastic rules   vinaya     most scholars regard the traditional accounts of the council as greatly exaggerated if not entirely fictitious     note 36   richard gombrich noted sariputta led communal recitations of the buddha  s teaching for preservation in the buddha  s lifetime in sangiti sutta   digha nikaya   33     and something similar to the first council must have taken place to compose buddhist scriptures

1193 according to most scholars   at some period after the second council the sangha began to break into separate factions     note 37   the various accounts differ as to when the actual schisms occurred   according to the dipavamsa of the p li tradition   they started immediately after the second council   the puggalavada tradition places it in 137 an   the sarvastivada tradition of vasumitra says it was in the time of ashoka and the mahasanghika tradition places it much later   nearly 100 bce

1194 the root schism was between the sthaviras and the mah s  ghikas   the fortunate survival of accounts from both sides of the dispute reveals disparate traditions   the sthavira group offers two quite distinct reasons for the schism   the dipavamsa of the therav da says that the losing party in the second council dispute broke away in protest and formed the mahasanghika   this contradicts the mahasanghikas   own vinaya   which shows them as on the same   winning side   the mah s  ghikas argued that the sthaviras were trying to expand the vinaya and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for arhatship   both parties   therefore   appealed to tradition
the major schism was between the sthaviras and what other group	mahasanghikas	64	64
1195 the sthaviras gave rise to several schools   one of which was the therav da school   originally   these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya   and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries   but eventually   by about 100 ce if not earlier   schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too

1196 following   or leading up to   the schisms   each sa gha started to accumulate an abhidharma   a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the suttas   according to schematic classifications   these abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises   but summaries or numerical lists   scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century bce   100 to 200 years after the death of the buddha   therefore the seven abhidharma works are generally claimed not to represent the words of the buddha himself   but those of disciples and great scholars     note 38   every school had its own version of the abhidharma   with different theories and different texts   the different abhidharmas of the various schools did not agree with each other   scholars disagree on whether the mahasanghika school had an abhidhamma pitaka or not     note 38

1200 there is no evidence that mah y na ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of buddhism   but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals   and later doctrines   for bodhisattvas   initially it was known as bodhisattvay na   the    vehicle of the bodhisattvas        paul williams has also noted that the mah y na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of buddhism   and therefore each bhik u or bhik u   adhering to the mah y na formally belonged to an early school   this continues today with the dharmaguptaka ordination lineage in east asia   and the m lasarv stiv da ordination lineage in tibetan buddhism   therefore mah y na was never a separate rival sect of the early schools   from chinese monks visiting india   we now know that both mah y na and non mah y na monks in india often lived in the same monasteries side by side

1202 during the period of late mahayana buddhism   four major types of thought developed   madhyamaka   yogacara   tathagatagarbha   and buddhist logic as the last and most recent   in india   the two main philosophical schools of the mahayana were the madhyamaka and the later yogacara   according to dan lusthaus   madhyamaka and yogacara have a great deal in common   and the commonality stems from early buddhism   there were no great indian teachers associated with tathagatagarbha thought

1400 most breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old   having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles   through this selective breeding   the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds   and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal   for example   height measured to the withers ranges from 15 2 centimetres   6 0 in   in the chihuahua to about 76 cm   30 in   in the irish wolfhound   color varies from white through grays   usually called    blue      to black   and browns from light   tan   to dark      red    or    chocolate      in a wide variation of patterns   coats can be short or long   coarse haired to wool like   straight   curly   or smooth   it is common for most breeds to shed this coat

1515 the ultimate substantive legacy of principia mathematica is mixed   it is generally accepted that kurt g del  s incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics   there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them   and hence that principia mathematica could never achieve its aims   however   g del could not have come to this conclusion without whitehead and russell  s book   in this way   principia mathematica  s legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals   but beyond this somewhat ironic legacy   the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic   epistemology   and metaphysics

1516 whitehead  s most complete work on education is the 1929 book the aims of education and other essays   which collected numerous essays and addresses by whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927  the essay from which aims of education derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when whitehead was president of the london branch of the mathematical association   in it   he cautioned against the teaching of what he called    inert ideas      ideas that are disconnected scraps of information   with no application to real life or culture   he opined that    education with inert ideas is not only useless   it is   above all things   harmful

1517 rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects   whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge   discovering their application in actual life   for whitehead   education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary   value free school model   it should be transdisciplinary   and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate
what did whitehead believe regarding the variety of subjects in education	whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts	11	18
1518 whitehead did not begin his career as a philosopher   in fact   he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education   early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics   but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur   in one letter to his friend and former student bertrand russell   after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive   he wrote      this further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic   onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter      ironically   in later life whitehead would become one of the 20th century  s foremost metaphysicians
what was the extent of whitehead  s education in philosophy	he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education	11	22
1519 whitehead was unimpressed by this objection   in the notes of one his students for a 1927 class   whitehead was quoted as saying      every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics   what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized      in whitehead  s view   scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time   but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned   while whitehead acknowledged that    philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles      he argued that people need to continually re imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress   even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic   for this reason whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy
what quotation of whitehead  s was noted by a student in 1927	every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics   what he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized	22	46
1520 perhaps foremost among what whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another   which he rejected in favor of an event based or    process    ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another   he also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential   indeed that everything is constituted by its experience   he used the term    experience    very broadly   so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience   in this   he went against descartes   separation of two different kinds of real existence   either exclusively material or else exclusively mental   whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as    philosophy of organism      but it would become known more widely as    process philosophy

1521 in whitehead  s view   then   concepts such as    quality         matter      and    form    are problematic   these    classical    concepts fail to adequately account for change   and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world   they are useful abstractions   but are not the world  s basic building blocks   what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person   for instance   is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events   after all   people change all the time   if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience   these occasions of experience are logically distinct   but are progressively connected in what whitehead calls a    society    of events   by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe   materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete   what whitehead calls the    fallacy of misplaced concreteness
how did whitehead define the    fallacy of misplaced concreteness	by assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe   materialists have mistaken the abstract for the concrete	111	133
1522 to put it another way   a thing or person is often seen as having a    defining essence    or a    core identity    that is unchanging   and describes what the thing or person really is   in this way of thinking   things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time   with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity   e g      mark  s hair has turned gray as he has gotten older   but he is still the same person        but in whitehead  s cosmology   the only fundamentally existent things are discrete    occasions of experience    that overlap one another in time and space   and jointly make up the enduring person or thing   on the other hand   what ordinary thinking often regards as    the essence of a thing    or    the identity core of a person    is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing  s most important or salient features across time   identities do not define people   people define identities   everything changes from moment to moment   and to think of anything as having an    enduring essence    misses the fact that    all things flow      though it is often a useful way of speaking
what did whitehead believe were essentially the only things that truly exist	discrete    occasions of experience    that overlap one another in time and space   and jointly make up the enduring person or thing	91	111
1523 whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking   and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech   after all   each moment of each person  s life can hardly be given a different proper name   and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things   rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago   yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that    material substances    or    essences    are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular   concrete processes   no one questions that a ten year old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old   and in many ways is not the same person at all   whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next
why did whitehead think people continued to subscribe to materialistic thinking	it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things	55	71
1524 a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations   it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects   each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things   the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space   and not necessarily related to anything   but in whitehead  s view   relations take a primary role   perhaps even more important than the relata themselves   a student taking notes in one of whitehead  s fall 1924 classes wrote that
what is the general materialistic view of an object	each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things	25	41
1525 in fact   whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities   its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it   a real thing is just that which forces the rest of the universe to in some way conform to it   that is to say   if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity   i e   it was not related to any other entity     it could not be said to really exist   relations are not secondary to what a thing is   they are what the thing is

1526 isabelle stengers wrote that    whiteheadians are recruited among both philosophers and theologians   and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons   from ecology to feminism   practices that unite political struggle and spirituality with the sciences of education      indeed   in recent decades attention to whitehead  s work has become more widespread   with interest extending to intellectuals in europe and china   and coming from such diverse fields as ecology   physics   biology   education   economics   and psychology   one of the first theologians to attempt to interact with whitehead  s thought was the future archbishop of canterbury   william temple   in temple  s gifford lectures of 1932 1934   subsequently published as    nature   man and god        whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the emergent evolution approach temple interacts with   however   it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that whitehead  s thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians   primarily americans   and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles

1527 early followers of whitehead were found primarily at the university of chicago  s divinity school   where henry nelson wieman initiated an interest in whitehead  s work that would last for about thirty years   professors such as wieman   charles hartshorne   bernard loomer   bernard meland   and daniel day williams made whitehead  s philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the divinity school   they taught generations of whitehead scholars   the most notable of which is john b  cobb   jr

1528 but while claremont remains the most concentrated hub of whiteheadian activity   the place where whitehead  s thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in china   in order to address the challenges of modernization and industrialization   china has begun to blend traditions of taoism   buddhism   and confucianism with whitehead  s    constructive post modern    philosophy in order to create an    ecological civilization      to date   the chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty three university based centers for the study of whitehead  s philosophy   and books by process philosophers john cobb and david ray griffin are becoming required reading for chinese graduate students   cobb has attributed china  s interest in process philosophy partly to whitehead  s stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature   as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts
where is interest in whitehead  s work growing the fastest today	china	27	27
1529 deleuze  s and latour  s opinions   however   are minority ones   as whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools   it is impossible to say exactly why whitehead  s influence has not been more widespread   but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter intuitive   such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction     or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy   or the perception of metaphysics itself as pass    or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose
what is an example of whitehead  s ideas being counter intuitive	his assertion that matter is an abstraction	56	62
1530 one philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is american pragmatism   whitehead himself thought highly of william james and john dewey   and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to process and reality   charles hartshorne   along with paul weiss   edited the collected papers of charles sanders peirce   one of the founders of pragmatism   noted neopragmatist richard rorty was in turn a student of hartshorne   today   nicholas rescher is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism

1531 in physics   whitehead  s thought has had some influence   he articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to einstein  s general relativity   see whitehead  s theory of gravitation   it has been severely criticized   yutaka tanaka   who suggests that the gravitational constant disagrees with experimental findings   proposes that einstein  s work does not actually refute whitehead  s formulation   whitehead  s view has now been rendered obsolete   with the discovery of gravitational waves   they are phenonena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that whitehead assumes   consequently   whitehead  s cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation   and his assumption of a uniform spatio temporal geometry   minkowskian in particular   as an often locally adequate approximation   an exact replacement of whitehead  s cosmology would need to admit a riemannian geometry   also   although whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to quantum theory   his metaphysics of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field   henry stapp and david bohm are among those whose work has been influenced by whitehead

1532 this work has been pioneered by john b  cobb   jr    whose book is it too late   a theology of ecology   1971   was the first single authored book in environmental ethics   cobb also co authored a book with economist herman daly entitled for the common good   redirecting the economy toward community   the environment   and a sustainable future   1989     which applied whitehead  s thought to economics   and received the grawemeyer award for ideas improving world order   cobb followed this with a second book   sustaining the common good   a christian perspective on the global economy   1994     which aimed to challenge    economists   zealous faith in the great god of growth

1533 another model is the feels model developed by xie bangxiu and deployed successfully in china      feels    stands for five things in curriculum and education   flexible goals   engaged learner   embodied knowledge   learning through interactions   and supportive teacher   it is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to    help a person become whole      this work is in part the product of cooperation between chinese government organizations and the institute for the postmodern development of china

1534 whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory   this has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events   as opposed to static things   within organizations through an  organization studies  discourse that accommodates a variety of  weak   and  strong   process perspectives from a number of philosophers   one of the leading figures having an explicitly whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is mark dibben   who works in what he calls    applied process thought    to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics   for dibben   this allows    a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing   as opposed to occasional   and thoroughly passive   happening      dibben has published two books on applied process thought   applied process thought i   initial explorations in theory and research   2008     and applied process thought ii   following a trail ablaze   2009     as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics

1535 beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s   whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to philosophy of science   and finally to metaphysics   he developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of western philosophy   whitehead argued that reality consists of processes rather than material objects   and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes   thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another   today whitehead  s philosophical works   particularly process and reality   are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy

1536 alfred north whitehead was born in ramsgate   kent   england   in 1861  his father   alfred whitehead   was a minister and schoolmaster of chatham house academy   a successful school for boys established by thomas whitehead   alfred north  s grandfather   whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters   but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man   whitehead  s mother was maria sarah whitehead   formerly maria sarah buckmaster   whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother   as he never mentioned her in any of his writings   and there is evidence that whitehead  s wife   evelyn   had a low opinion of her
where was alfred north whitehead born	ramsgate   kent   england	6	8
1537 in 1918 whitehead  s academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the university of london system   of which imperial college london was a member at the time   he was elected dean of the faculty of science at the university of london in late 1918   a post he held for four years     a member of the university of london  s senate in 1919   and chairman of the senate  s academic   leadership   council in 1920   a post which he held until he departed for america in 1924  whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department   help establish a bachelor of science degree   previously only bachelor of arts degrees had been offered     and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students
in which educational system was whitehead employed in the late 1910s	university of london system	21	24
1538 the two volume biography of whitehead by victor lowe is the most definitive presentation of the life of whitehead   however   many details of whitehead  s life remain obscure because he left no nachlass   his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death   additionally   whitehead was known for his    almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy      and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life   this led to lowe himself remarking on the first page of whitehead  s biography      no professional biographer in his right mind would touch him
who authored whitehead  s biography that is considered to be the most reliable description of whitehead  s life	victor lowe	7	8
1539 in addition to numerous articles on mathematics   whitehead wrote three major books on the subject   a treatise on universal algebra   1898     principia mathematica   co written with bertrand russell and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913     and an introduction to mathematics   1911     the former two books were aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians   while the latter book was intended for a larger audience   covering the history of mathematics and its philosophical foundations   principia mathematica in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century
what was whitehead  s first published book on mathematics	a treatise on universal algebra	15	19
1540 at the time structures such as lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class   in a review alexander macfarlane wrote      the main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods   nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them   but rather the comparative study of their several structures      in a separate review   g  b  mathews wrote      it possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable   considering the variety of its themes
what did lie algebras and hyperbolic quaternions demonstrate a need for	the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class	14	24
1541 whitehead and russell had thought originally that principia mathematica would take a year to complete   it ended up taking them ten years   to add insult to injury   when it came time for publication   the three volume work was so massive   more than 2 000 pages   and its audience so narrow   professional mathematicians   that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds   300 of which was paid by cambridge university press   200 by the royal society of london   and 50 apiece by whitehead and russell themselves   despite the initial loss   today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of principia mathematica
how long did whitehead and russell expect to spend creating principia mathematica	a year	11	12
1542 this is not to say that whitehead  s thought was widely accepted or even well understood   his philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the western canon   even professional philosophers struggled to follow whitehead  s writings   one famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of whitehead  s philosophy centers around the delivery of whitehead  s gifford lectures in 1927 28   following arthur eddington  s lectures of the year previous   which whitehead would later publish as process and reality

1543 however   mathews   frustration with whitehead  s books did not negatively affect his interest   in fact   there were numerous philosophers and theologians at chicago  s divinity school that perceived the importance of what whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications   in 1927 they invited one of america  s only whitehead experts   henry nelson wieman   to chicago to give a lecture explaining whitehead  s thought   wieman  s lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years   and for at least thirty years afterward chicago  s divinity school was closely associated with whitehead  s thought
what affect did matthews   opinion of the difficulty of whitehead  s works have on his interest in them	mathews   frustration with whitehead  s books did not negatively affect his interest	1	12
1544 wieman  s words proved prophetic   though process and reality has been called    arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century      it has been little read and little understood   partly because it demands   as isabelle stengers puts it      that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus      whitehead questioned western philosophy  s most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works   but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions
how has    process and reality    been described	arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century	12	22
1545 it must be emphasized   however   that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations   but also a valuation of them and reaction to them   for whitehead   creativity is the absolute principle of existence   and every entity   whether it is a human being   a tree   or an electron   has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities   and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws   of course   most entities do not have consciousness   as a human being  s actions can not always be predicted   the same can be said of where a tree  s roots will grow   or how an electron will move   or whether it will rain tomorrow   moreover   inability to predict an electron  s movement   for instance   is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology   rather   the fundamental creativity freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable
what did whitehead believe regarding creativity	creativity is the absolute principle of existence	28	34
1546 since whitehead  s metaphysics described a universe in which all entities experience   he needed a new way of describing perception that was not limited to living   self conscious beings   the term he coined was    prehension      which comes from the latin prehensio   meaning    to seize      the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious   applying to people as well as electrons   it is also intended to make clear whitehead  s rejection of the theory of representative perception   in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities   for whitehead   the term    prehension    indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself   in this way   entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations   rather than being independent of them   further   whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes   causal efficacy   or    physical prehension      and presentational immediacy   or    conceptual prehension
what is the origin of the word    prehension	comes from the latin prehensio   meaning    to seize	36	43
1547 whitehead describes causal efficacy as    the experience dominating the primitive living organisms   which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged   and the fate towards which they go      it is   in other words   the sense of causal relations between entities   a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment   unmediated by the senses   presentational immediacy   on the other hand   is what is usually referred to as    pure sense perception      unmediated by any causal or symbolic interpretation   even unconscious interpretation   in other words   it is pure appearance   which may or may not be delusive   e g   mistaking an image in a mirror for    the real thing
how do the senses affect causal efficacy	unmediated by the senses	54	57
1548 in higher organisms   like people     these two modes of perception combine into what whitehead terms    symbolic reference      which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it   by way of illustration   whitehead uses the example of a person  s encounter with a chair   an ordinary person looks up   sees a colored shape   and immediately infers that it is a chair   however   an artist   whitehead supposes      might not have jumped to the notion of a chair      but instead    might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape      this is not the normal human reaction   most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct   without even thinking about it   moreover   animals do the same thing   using the same example   whitehead points out that a dog    would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such      in this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other   and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality   as the dog illustrates     while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality   as the artist illustrates
which concept does whitehead state is more dominant in a lower mentality	causal relationships	194	195
1549 whitehead makes the startling observation that    life is comparatively deficient in survival value      if humans can only exist for about a hundred years   and rocks for eight hundred million   then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place   as whitehead humorously notes      they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them      he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment   an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three fold goal of living   living well   and living better   in other words   whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction   without such a goal   he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible
what observation did whitehead make about life	life is comparatively deficient in survival value	6	12
1550 whitehead  s idea of god differs from traditional monotheistic notions   perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the christian conception of god is that    the church gave unto god the attributes which belonged exclusively to caesar      here whitehead is criticizing christianity for defining god as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world   and whose most important attribute is power   as opposed to the most widely accepted forms of christianity   whitehead emphasized an idea of god that he called    the brief galilean vision of humility
what was whitehead  s description of god	the brief galilean vision of humility	83	88
1551 it should be emphasized   however   that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion   rather than springing primarily from religious faith   whitehead saw god as necessary for his metaphysical system   his system required that an order exist among possibilities   an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities   whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of god   however   whitehead was also interested in religious experience   this led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of god   the consequent nature   whitehead  s conception of god as a    dipolar    entity has called for fresh theological thinking
what was whitehead  s belief about god in relation to religion	god is not necessarily tied to religion	8	14
1552 god  s consequent nature   on the other hand   is anything but unchanging   it is god  s reception of the world  s activity   as whitehead puts it        god   saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life   it is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved      in other words   god saves and cherishes all experiences forever   and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world   in this way   god is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe   lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance
how does whitehead define he consequent nature of god	god  s reception of the world  s activity	14	21
1553 whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another   he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into god  s self   thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time   on the other hand   he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change   alone   god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities   and requires the world to actualize them   god gives creatures permanence   while the creatures give god actuality and change   here it is worthwhile to quote whitehead at length
in what way did whitehead view god as deficient	deficient in actuality and change	62	66
1554 for whitehead the core of religion was individual   while he acknowledged that individuals can not ever be fully separated from their society   he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others   his most famous remark on religion is that    religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness     and if you are never solitary   you are never religious      whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person  s character   he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence   it is not necessarily good   an idea which he called a    dangerous delusion      e g    a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion  s adherents
what did whitehead believe was the basis of religion	individual	7	7
1555 however   while whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness   he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual   in keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary   he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of    the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals      in other words   the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others   meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone   but only in the context of the universal community   whitehead writes further that each entity    can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe   religion is world loyalty   the spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself      in this way the individual and universal social aspects of religion are mutually dependent
in what state did whitehead believe religion began	solitariness	8	8
1556 overall   however   whitehead  s influence is very difficult to characterize   in english speaking countries   his primary works are little studied outside of claremont and a select number of liberal graduate level theology and philosophy programs   outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse   and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than whitehead himself   for instance   whitehead was a teacher and long time friend and collaborator of bertrand russell   and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of willard van orman quine   both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy   the dominant strain of philosophy in english speaking countries in the 20th century   whitehead has also had high profile admirers in the continental tradition   such as french post structuralist philosopher gilles deleuze   who once dryly remarked of whitehead that    he stands provisionally as the last great anglo american philosopher before wittgenstein  s disciples spread their misty confusion   sufficiency   and terror      french sociologist and anthropologist bruno latour even went so far as to call whitehead    the greatest philosopher of the 20th century
where has interest outside of those areas mainly come from	through the work of his students and admirers rather	52	60
1557 historically whitehead  s work has been most influential in the field of american progressive theology   the most important early proponent of whitehead  s thought in a theological context was charles hartshorne   who spent a semester at harvard as whitehead  s teaching assistant in 1925   and is widely credited with developing whitehead  s process philosophy into a full blown process theology   other notable process theologians include john b  cobb   jr    david ray griffin   marjorie hewitt suchocki   c  robert mesle   roland faber   and catherine keller

1558 process theology typically stresses god  s relational nature   rather than seeing god as impassive or emotionless   process theologians view god as    the fellow sufferer who understands      and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events   hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers   so why would this be a praise worthy quality in god   instead   as the being who is most affected by the world   god is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world   however   process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways   c  robert mesle   for instance   advocates a    process naturalism      i e   a process theology without god

1559 in fact   process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests   john b  cobb   jr  is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics   roland faber and catherine keller integrate whitehead with poststructuralist   postcolonialist   and feminist theory   charles birch was both a theologian and a geneticist   franklin i  gamwell writes on theology and political theory   in syntheism   creating god in the internet age   futurologists alexander bard and jan s derqvist repeatedly credit whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era

1560 whitehead also described religion more technically as    an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone      in other words   religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world   helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance   for whitehead   religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society   it is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people

1561 margaret stout and carrie m  staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of whitehead and mary parker follett   a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and organizational behavior   stout and staton see both whitehead and follett as sharing an ontology that    understands becoming as a relational process   difference as being related   yet unique   and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference      this connection is further analyzed by stout and jeannine m  love in integrative process   follettian thinking from ontology to administration

1562 moreover   a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients   combined with a global glut in investment capital   led to bad investments by asset managers in over priced credit assets   professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management   there is   therefore   an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation   as the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline   asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients   many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over priced   under yielding   investments   to the detriment of their clients   in order to maintain their assets under management   this choice was supported by a    plausible deniability    of the risks associated with subprime based credit assets because the loss experience with early    vintages    of subprime loans was so low

1563 the first visible institution to run into trouble in the united states was the southern california based indymac   a spin off of countrywide financial   before its failure   indymac bank was the largest savings and loan association in the los angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the united states   the failure of indymac bank on july 11   2008   was the fourth largest bank failure in united states history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures   and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift   indymac bank  s parent corporation was indymac bancorp until the fdic seized indymac bank   indymac bancorp filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in july 2008

1565 senator charles schumer   d ny   would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of indymac  s total deposits and ask the federal deposit insurance corporation   fdic   whether it had considered ordering indymac to reduce its reliance on these deposits   with   18 9 billion in total deposits reported on march 31   senator schumer would have been referring to a little over   7 billion in brokered deposits   while the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly   a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to indymac at   500 million a month   had the regulator disallowed indymac from acquiring new brokered deposits on june 30

1566 when home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed   indymac was forced to hold   10 7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market   its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late june 2008 when account holders withdrew   1 55 billion or about 7 5   of indymac  s deposits   this  run  on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from senator charles schumer to the fdic and ots   the letter outlined the senator s concerns with indymac   while the run was a contributing factor in the timing of indymac s demise   the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated

1567 on july 11   2008   citing liquidity concerns   the fdic put indymac bank into conservatorship   a bridge bank   indymac federal bank   fsb   was established to assume control of indymac bank  s assets   its secured liabilities   and its insured deposit accounts   the fdic announced plans to open indymac federal bank   fsb on july 14   2008  until then   depositors would have access their insured deposits through atms   their existing checks   and their existing debit cards   telephone and internet account access was restored when the bank reopened   the fdic guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to us   100 000   and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10 000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount   guaranteeing 50   of any amounts in excess of   100 000   yet   even with the pending sale of indymac to imb management holdings   an estimated 10 000 uninsured depositors of indymac are still at a loss of over   270 million

1568 initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as northern rock and countrywide financial   as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets   over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008  concerns that investment bank bear stearns would collapse in march 2008 resulted in its fire sale to jp morgan chase   the financial institution crisis hit its peak in september and october 2008  several major institutions either failed   were acquired under duress   or were subject to government takeover   these included lehman brothers   merrill lynch   fannie mae   freddie mac   washington mutual   wachovia   citigroup   and aig   on oct  6   2008   three weeks after lehman brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in u s  history   lehman  s former ceo found himself before representative henry a  waxman   the california democrat who chaired the house committee on oversight and government reform   fuld said he was a victim of the collapse   blaming a    crisis of confidence    in the markets for dooming his firm

1570 economist paul krugman and u s  treasury secretary timothy geithner explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system   which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above   without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage backed securities or asset backed commercial paper   investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations

1571 this meant that nearly one third of the u s  lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into june 2009  according to the brookings institution   the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009      it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume      the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are    likely to vanish forever   having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions      while traditional banks have raised their lending standards   it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing

1572 there is a direct relationship between declines in wealth and declines in consumption and business investment   which along with government spending   represent the economic engine   between june 2007 and november 2008   americans lost an estimated average of more than a quarter of their collective net worth     citation needed   by early november 2008   a broad u s  stock index the s   p 500   was down 45   from its 2007 high   housing prices had dropped 20   from their 2006 peak   with futures markets signaling a 30 35   potential drop   total home equity in the united states   which was valued at   13 trillion at its peak in 2006   had dropped to   8 8 trillion by mid 2008 and was still falling in late 2008  total retirement assets   americans   second largest household asset   dropped by 22     from   10 3 trillion in 2006 to   8 trillion in mid 2008   during the same period   savings and investment assets   apart from retirement savings   lost   1 2 trillion and pension assets lost   1 3 trillion   taken together   these losses total a staggering   8 3 trillion   since peaking in the second quarter of 2007   household wealth is down   14 trillion

1573 in november 2008   economist dean baker observed      there is a really good reason for tighter credit   tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today   businesses are facing the worst downturn since the great depression   this matters for credit decisions   a homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt   they will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and or have a default placed on their credit record   on the other hand   a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk   in the case of businesses   their creditworthiness depends on their future profits   profit prospects look much worse in november 2008 than they did in november 2007     while many banks are obviously at the brink   consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid   the problem with the economy is the loss of close to   6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth

1574 several commentators have suggested that if the liquidity crisis continues   an extended recession or worse could occur   the continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative   the financial crisis is likely to yield the biggest banking shakeout since the savings and loan meltdown   investment bank ubs stated on october 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession   with recovery unlikely for at least two years   three days later ubs economists announced that the    beginning of the end    of the crisis had begun   with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis   capital injection by governments   injection made systemically   interest rate cuts to help borrowers   the united kingdom had started systemic injection   and the world  s central banks were now cutting interest rates   ubs emphasized the united states needed to implement systemic injection   ubs further emphasized that this fixes only the financial crisis   but that in economic terms    the worst is still to come      ubs quantified their expected recession durations on october 16   the eurozone  s would last two quarters   the united states   would last three quarters   and the united kingdom  s would last four quarters   the economic crisis in iceland involved all three of the country  s major banks   relative to the size of its economy   iceland s banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history

1584 the collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending   extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees   this essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority   those securities first in line received investment grade ratings from rating agencies   securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested

1586 lower interest rates encouraged borrowing   from 2000 to 2003   the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6 5   to 1 0     this was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot com bubble and the september 2001 terrorist attacks   as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation   as early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the fed    needs to create a housing bubble to replace the nasdaq bubble      moreover   empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis

1588 the fed then raised the fed funds rate significantly between july 2004 and july 2006  this contributed to an increase in 1 year and 5 year adjustable rate mortgage   arm   rates   making arm interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners   this may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble   as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates   and it became riskier to speculate in housing   u s  housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst

1591 predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders   enticing borrowers to enter into    unsafe    or    unsound    secured loans for inappropriate purposes   a classic bait and switch method was used by countrywide financial   advertising low interest rates for home refinancing   such loans were written into extensively detailed contracts   and swapped for more expensive loan products on the day of closing   whereas the advertisement might state that 1   or 1 5   interest would be charged   the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage   arm   in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid   this created negative amortization   which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated

1594 prior to the crisis   financial institutions became highly leveraged   increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses   much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off balance sheet securitization and derivatives   which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels   these instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy   and contributed to the need for government bailouts

1595 from 2004 to 2007   the top five u s  investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage   see diagram     which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock   changes in capital requirements   intended to keep u s  banks competitive with their european counterparts   allowed lower risk weightings for aaa securities   the shift from first loss tranches to aaa tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage   these five institutions reported over   4 1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007   about 30   of usa nominal gdp for 2007  lehman brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated   bear stearns and merrill lynch were sold at fire sale prices   and goldman sachs and morgan stanley became commercial banks   subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation   with the exception of lehman   these companies required or received government support   lehman reported that it had been in talks with bank of america and barclays for the company  s possible sale   however   both barclays and bank of america ultimately declined to purchase the entire company

1596 behavior that may be optimal for an individual   e g    saving more during adverse economic conditions   can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior   as ultimately one person  s consumption is another person  s income   too many consumers attempting to save   or pay down debt   simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession   economist hyman minsky also described a    paradox of deleveraging    as financial institutions that have too much leverage   debt relative to equity   can not all de leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets

1597 during april 2009   u s  federal reserve vice chair janet yellen discussed these paradoxes      once this massive credit crunch hit   it didn t take long before we were in a recession   the recession   in turn   deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell   and credit losses of financial institutions surged   indeed   we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year   a process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy   consumers are pulling back on purchases   especially on durable goods   to build their savings   businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash   and   financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm   once again   minsky understood this dynamic   he spoke of the paradox of deleveraging   in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole

1598 the term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives   such as offsetting a particular risk exposure   such as the default of a borrower   or to assist with obtaining financing   examples pertinent to this crisis included   the adjustable rate mortgage   the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage backed securities   mbs   or collateralized debt obligations   cdo   for sale to investors   a type of securitization   and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps   cds     the usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis   these products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions

1599 cdo issuance grew from an estimated   20 billion in q1 2004 to its peak of over   180 billion by q1 2007   then declined back under   20 billion by q1 2008  further   the credit quality of cdo  s declined from 2000 to 2007   as the level of subprime and other non prime mortgage debt increased from 5   to 36   of cdo assets   as described in the section on subprime lending   the cds and portfolio of cds called synthetic cdo enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding   provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found   for example   buying a cds to insure a cdo ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the cdo   when those cdo  s became worthless

1600 this boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity   it multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage   including mortgage brokers   specialized originators   the securitizers and their due diligence firms   managing agents and trading desks   and finally investors   insurances and providers of repo funding     with increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information   including fico scores on creditworthiness   appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations   and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks     instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts   misjudgments and finally market collapse   in 2005 a group of computer scientists built a computational model for the mechanism of biased ratings produced by rating agencies   which turned out to be adequate to what actually happened in 2006 2008     citation needed

1601 the pricing of risk refers to the incremental compensation required by investors for taking on additional risk   which may be measured by interest rates or fees   several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks   risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis   enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have   and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward   readily understandable format

1602 for a variety of reasons   market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as mbs and cdos or understand its impact on the overall stability of the financial system   for example   the pricing model for cdos clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system   banks estimated that   450bn of cdo were sold between    late 2005 to the middle of 2007      among the   102bn of those that had been liquidated   jpmorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for    high quality    cdos was approximately 32 cents on the dollar   while the recovery rate for mezzanine cdo was approximately five cents for every dollar

1603 another example relates to aig   which insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps   the basic cds transaction involved aig receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party a in the event party b defaulted   however   aig did not have the financial strength to support its many cds commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in september 2008  u s  taxpayers provided over   180 billion in government support to aig during 2008 and early 2009   through which the money flowed to various counterparties to cds transactions   including many large global financial institutions

1604 as financial assets became more and more complex   and harder and harder to value   investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators   who came to rely on them   accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be   george soros commented that    the super boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves   similarly   the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products   it was a shocking abdication of responsibility

1605 despite the dominance of the above formula   there are documented attempts of the financial industry   occurring before the crisis   to address the formula limitations   specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events   the volume    credit correlation   life after copulas      published in 2007 by world scientific   summarizes a 2006 conference held by merrill lynch in london where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations   see also the article by donnelly and embrechts and the book by brigo   pallavicini and torresetti   that reports relevant warnings and research on cdos appeared in 2006

1606 in a june 2008 speech   president and ceo of the new york federal reserve bank timothy geithner who in 2009 became secretary of the united states treasury placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a    run    on the entities in the    parallel    banking system   also called the shadow banking system   these entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system   but were not subject to the same regulatory controls   further   these entities were vulnerable because of maturity mismatch   meaning that they borrowed short term in liquid markets to purchase long term   illiquid and risky assets   this meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging   selling their long term assets at depressed prices   he described the significance of these entities

1607 the securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut down in the fall of 2008  more than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds   according to the brookings institution   the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of june 2009      it would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume      the authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are    likely to vanish forever   having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions

1609 rapid increases in a number of commodity prices followed the collapse in the housing bubble   the price of oil nearly tripled from   50 to   147 from early 2007 to 2008   before plunging as the financial crisis began to take hold in late 2008  experts debate the causes   with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities   some to monetary policy   and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast growing world   leading to long positions taken on those markets   such as chinese increasing presence in africa   an increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline   which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries   as wealth flows to oil producing states   a pattern of spiking instability in the price of oil over the decade leading up to the price high of 2008 has been recently identified   the destabilizing effects of this price variance has been proposed as a contributory factor in the financial crisis

1628 as part of the housing and credit booms   the number of financial agreements called mortgage backed securities   mbs   and collateralized debt obligations   cdo     which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices   greatly increased   such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the u s  housing market   as housing prices declined   major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime mbs reported significant losses

1630 while the housing and credit bubbles were building   a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile   a process called financialization   u s  government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business   which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions   thus   policymakers did not immediately recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds   also known as the shadow banking system   some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial   depository   banks in providing credit to the u s  economy   but they were not subject to the same regulations

1633 during a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share   and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited   mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers   in the view of some analysts   the relatively conservative government sponsored enterprises   gses   policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003  however   as market power shifted from securitizers to originators and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined gse power   mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated   the worst loans were originated in 2004 2007   the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the gses

1635 in his dissent to the majority report of the financial crisis inquiry commission   american enterprise institute fellow peter j  wallison stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by hud in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government sponsored entities fannie mae and freddie mac   later   based upon information in the sec  s december 2011 securities fraud case against 6 ex executives of fannie and freddie   peter wallison and edward pinto estimated that   in 2008   fannie and freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over   2 trillion

1637 a 2000 united states department of the treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that   467 billion of mortgage lending was made by community reinvestment act   cra    covered lenders into low and mid level income   lmi   borrowers and neighborhoods   representing 10   of all u s  mortgage lending during the period   the majority of these were prime loans   sub prime loans made by cra covered institutions constituted a 3   market share of lmi loans in 1998   but in the run up to the crisis   fully 25   of all sub prime lending occurred at cra covered institutions and another 25   of sub prime loans had some connection with cra   in addition   an analysis by the federal reserve bank of dallas in 2009   however   concluded that the cra was not responsible for the mortgage loan crisis   pointing out that cra rules have been in place since 1995 whereas the poor lending emerged only a decade later   furthermore   most sub prime loans were not made to the lmi borrowers targeted by the cra   especially in the years 2005 2006 leading up to the crisis   nor did it find any evidence that lending under the cra rules increased delinquency rates or that the cra indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub prime lending

1638 to other analysts the delay between cra rule changes   in 1995   and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising   and does not exonerate the cra   they contend that there were two   connected causes to the crisis   the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra low interest rates initiated by the federal reserve after the terrorist attack on september 11   2001  both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place   critics also point out that publicly announced cra loan commitments were massive   totaling   4 5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007  they also argue that the federal reserve s classification of cra loans as  prime  is based on the faulty and self serving assumption that high interest rate loans   3 percentage points over average   equal  subprime  loans

1639 others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude   in an article in portfolio magazine   michael lewis spoke with one trader who noted that    there weren t enough americans with   bad   credit taking out   bad loans   to satisfy investors   appetite for the end product      essentially   investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made   far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans   using derivatives called credit default swaps   collateralized debt obligations and synthetic cdos

1640 countering krugman   peter j  wallison wrote      it is not true that every bubble even a large bubble has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates      wallison notes that other developed countries had    large bubbles during the 1997 2007 period    but    the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the united states when the 1997 2007   bubble   deflated      according to wallison   the reason the u s  residential housing bubble   as opposed to other types of bubbles   led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans   generally with low or no downpayments

1673 whereas a genome sequence lists the order of every dna base in a genome   a genome map identifies the landmarks   a genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome   the human genome project was organized to map and to sequence the human genome   a fundamental step in the project was the release of a detailed genomic map by jean weissenbach and his team at the genoscope in paris

1674 genome composition is used to describe the make up of contents of a haploid genome   which should include genome size   proportions of non repetitive dna and repetitive dna in details   by comparing the genome compositions between genomes   scientists can better understand the evolutionary history of a given genome
what is the term that accounts for the constituents of the haploid genome	genome composition	0	1
1675 when talking about genome composition   one should distinguish between prokaryotes and eukaryotes as the big differences on contents structure they have   in prokaryotes   most of the genome   85 90     is non repetitive dna   which means coding dna mainly forms it   while non coding regions only take a small part   on the contrary   eukaryotes have the feature of exon intron organization of protein coding genes   the variation of repetitive dna content in eukaryotes is also extremely high   in mammals and plants   the major part of the genome is composed of repetitive dna
what two types of organisms have remarkable differences in their genomic composition	prokaryotes and eukaryotes	9	11
1676 most biological entities that are more complex than a virus sometimes or always carry additional genetic material besides that which resides in their chromosomes   in some contexts   such as sequencing the genome of a pathogenic microbe      genome    is meant to include information stored on this auxiliary material   which is carried in plasmids   in such circumstances then      genome    describes all of the genes and information on non coding dna that have the potential to be present
what is an example of an organism that has a portion of its genetic material outside of its chromosomes	pathogenic microbe	34	35
1677 in eukaryotes such as plants   protozoa and animals   however      genome    carries the typical connotation of only information on chromosomal dna   so although these organisms contain chloroplasts or mitochondria that have their own dna   the genetic information contained by dna within these organelles is not considered part of the genome   in fact   mitochondria are sometimes said to have their own genome often referred to as the    mitochondrial genome      the dna found within the chloroplast may be referred to as the    plastome
what are examples of classes of eukaryotes where genome only refers to the information found in chromosomes	plants   protozoa and animals	4	7
1678 genome size is the total number of dna base pairs in one copy of a haploid genome   the genome size is positively correlated with the morphological complexity among prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes   however   after mollusks and all the other higher eukaryotes above   this correlation is no longer effective   this phenomenon also indicates the mighty influence coming from repetitive dna act on the genomes
what is the name for the count of all dna base pairs in a single haploid genome	genome size	0	1
1679 since genomes are very complex   one research strategy is to reduce the number of genes in a genome to the bare minimum and still have the organism in question survive   there is experimental work being done on minimal genomes for single cell organisms as well as minimal genomes for multi cellular organisms   see developmental biology     the work is both in vivo and in silico
what is a name for the reduced complement of genetic material necessary for an organism to live	minimal genomes	37	38
1680 the proportion of non repetitive dna is calculated by using the length of non repetitive dna divided by genome size   protein coding genes and rna coding genes are generally non repetitive dna   a bigger genome does not mean more genes   and the proportion of non repetitive dna decreases along with increasing genome size in higher eukaryotes
what are two types of non repetitive dna	protein coding genes and rna coding genes	20	26
1681 it had been found that the proportion of non repetitive dna can vary a lot between species   some e  coli as prokaryotes only have non repetitive dna   lower eukaryotes such as c  elegans and fruit fly   still possess more non repetitive dna than repetitive dna   higher eukaryotes tend to have more repetitive dna than non repetitive ones   in some plants and amphibians   the proportion of non repetitive dna is no more than 20     becoming a minority component
what is an example of an organism which does not contain any repetitive dna	e  coli	18	19
1682 the proportion of repetitive dna is calculated by using length of repetitive dna divide by genome size   there are two categories of repetitive dna in genome   tandem repeats and interspersed repeats
what are two types of repetitive dna found in genomes	tandem repeats and interspersed repeats	26	30
1683 tandem repeats are usually caused by slippage during replication   unequal crossing over and gene conversion   satellite dna and microsatellites are forms of tandem repeats in the genome   although tandem repeats count for a significant proportion in genome   the largest proportion in mammalian is the other type   interspersed repeats
unequal crossing over can create what type of repetitive dna	tandem repeats	0	1
1684 interspersed repeats mainly come from transposable elements   tes     but they also include some protein coding gene families and pseudogenes   transposable elements are able to integrate into the genome at another site within the cell   it is believed that tes are an important driving force on genome evolution of higher eukaryotes   tes can be classified into two categories   class 1   retrotransposons   and class 2   dna transposons
what is the main source of interspersed repeats	transposable elements	5	6
1685 retrotransposons can be transcribed into rna   which are then duplicated at another site into the genome   retrotransposons can be divided into long terminal repeats   ltrs   and non long terminal repeats   non ltr
what kind of genetic material can be produced from retrotransposons	rna	5	5
1686 dna transposons generally move by    cut and paste    in the genome   but duplication has also been observed   class 2 tes do not use rna as intermediate and are popular in bacteria   in metazoan it has also been found
what is a term that can describe how dna transposons move	cut and paste	5	7
1687 genomes are more than the sum of an organism  s genes and have traits that may be measured and studied without reference to the details of any particular genes and their products   researchers compare traits such as chromosome number   karyotype     genome size   gene order   codon usage bias   and gc content to determine what mechanisms could have produced the great variety of genomes that exist today   for recent overviews   see brown 2002   saccone and pesole 2003   benfey and protopapas 2004   gibson and muse 2004   reese 2004   gregory 2005
what is another word for the total count of chromosomes	karyotype	39	39
1688 duplications play a major role in shaping the genome   duplication may range from extension of short tandem repeats   to duplication of a cluster of genes   and all the way to duplication of entire chromosomes or even entire genomes   such duplications are probably fundamental to the creation of genetic novelty
what type of generation of genetic material has a big part in making the genome what it is	duplications	0	0
1689 horizontal gene transfer is invoked to explain how there is often extreme similarity between small portions of the genomes of two organisms that are otherwise very distantly related   horizontal gene transfer seems to be common among many microbes   also   eukaryotic cells seem to have experienced a transfer of some genetic material from their chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to their nuclear chromosomes

1690 a comprehensive school is a state school that does not select its intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude   this is in contrast to the selective school system   where admission is restricted on the basis of selection criteria   the term is commonly used in relation to england and wales   where comprehensive schools were introduced on an experimental basis in the 1940s and became more widespread from 1965  about 90   of british secondary school pupils now attend comprehensive schools   they correspond broadly to the public high school in the united states and canada and to the german gesamtschule     citation needed
what kind of school does not base its admissions on academic merit	comprehensive school	1	2
1691 comprehensive schools are primarily about providing an entitlement curriculum to all children   without selection whether due to financial considerations or attainment   a consequence of that is a wider ranging curriculum   including practical subjects such as design and technology and vocational learning   which were less common or non existent in grammar schools   providing post 16 education cost effectively becomes more challenging for smaller comprehensive schools   because of the number of courses needed to cover a broader curriculum with comparatively fewer students   this is why schools have tended to get larger and also why many local authorities have organised secondary education into 11 16 schools   with the post 16 provision provided by sixth form colleges and further education colleges   comprehensive schools do not select their intake on the basis of academic achievement or aptitude   but there are demographic reasons why the attainment profiles of different schools vary considerably   in addition   government initiatives such as the city technology colleges and specialist schools programmes have made the comprehensive ideal less certain
what are some areas of learning in comprehensive schools that were not found often in grammar schools	design and technology and vocational learning	35	40
1692 in these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school  s specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment   a problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area   in the selective school system   which survives in several parts of the united kingdom   admission is dependent on selection criteria   most commonly a cognitive test or tests   although comprehensive schools were introduced to england and wales in 1965   there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation     citation needed     though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in england     most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16   but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools   and in some places the secondary level is divided into two   for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18   roughly corresponding to the us middle school   or junior high school   and high school   respectively   with the advent of key stages in the national curriculum some local authorities reverted from the middle school system to 11 16 and 11 18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another

1693 in principle   comprehensive schools were conceived as    neighbourhood    schools for all students in a specified catchment area   current education reforms with academies programme   free schools and university technical colleges will no doubt have some impact on the comprehensive ideal but it is too early to say to what degree

1703 comprehensive schools were introduced into ireland in 1966 by an initiative by patrick hillery   minister for education   to give a broader range of education compared to that of the vocational school system   which was then the only system of schools completely controlled by the state   until then   education in ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion   particularly the voluntary secondary school system was a particular realisation of this   the comprehensive school system is still relatively small and to an extent has been superseded by the community school concept   the irish word for a comprehensive school is a  scoil chuimsitheach
when did ireland first open comprehensive schools	1966	7	7
1704 in ireland comprehensive schools were an earlier model of state schools   introduced in the late 1960s and largely replaced by the secular community model of the 1970s   the comprehensive model generally incorporated older schools that were under roman catholic or protestant ownership   and the various denominations still manage the school as patrons or trustees   the state owns the school property   which is vested in the trustees in perpetuity   the model was adopted to make state schools more acceptable to a largely conservative society of the time
in what decade were community schools conceived	1970s	26	26
1705 the introduction of the community school model in the 1970s controversially removed the denominational basis of the schools   but religious interests were invited to be represented on the boards of management   community schools are divided into two models   the community school vested in the minister for education and the community college vested in the local education and training board   community colleges tended to be amalgamations of unviable local schools under the umbrella of a new community school model   but community schools have tended to be entirely new foundations

1709 by 1975 the majority of local authorities in england and wales had abandoned the 11 plus examination and moved to a comprehensive system   over that 10 year period many secondary modern schools and grammar schools were amalgamated to form large neighbourhood comprehensives   whilst a number of new schools were built to accommodate a growing school population   by the mid 1970s the system had been almost fully implemented   with virtually no secondary modern schools remaining   many grammar schools were either closed or changed to comprehensive status   some local authorities   including sandwell and dudley in the west midlands   changed all of its state secondary schools to comprehensive schools during the 1970s

1711 since the 1988 education reform act   parents have a right to choose which school their child should go to or whether to not send them to school at all and to home educate them instead   the concept of    school choice    introduces the idea of competition between state schools   a fundamental change to the original    neighbourhood comprehensive    model   and is partly intended as a means by which schools that are perceived to be inferior are forced either to improve or   if hardly anyone wants to go there   to close down   government policy is currently promoting  specialisation   whereby parents choose a secondary school appropriate for their child  s interests and skills   most initiatives focus on parental choice and information   implementing a pseudo market incentive to encourage better schools   this logic has underpinned the controversial league tables of school performance

1901 in fact   there was an eighth province   the county of drenthe   but this area was so poor it was exempt from paying federal taxes and as a consequence was denied representation in the states general   each province was governed by the provincial states   the main executive official   though not the official head of state   was a raadspensionaris   in times of war   the stadtholder   who commanded the army   would have more power than the raadspensionaris
what was the 8th province of the dutch republic	the county of drenthe	7	10
1902 in theory   the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province   however   in practice the princes of orange of the house of orange nassau   beginning with william the silent   were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces   zeeland and usually utrecht had the same stadtholder as holland
who appointed the stadtholders	the states of each province	11	15
1903 there was a constant power struggle between the orangists   who supported the stadtholders and specifically the princes of orange   and the republicans   who supported the states general and hoped to replace the semi hereditary nature of the stadtholdership with a true republican structure
what group of people supported the stadtholders   particularly the princes of orange	orangists	8	8
1904 after the peace of westphalia   several border territories were assigned to the united provinces   they were federally governed generality lands   generaliteitslanden     they were staats brabant   present north brabant     staats vlaanderen   present zeeuws vlaanderen     staats limburg   around maastricht   and staats oppergelre   around venlo   after 1715

1906 the framers of the us constitution were influenced by the constitution of the republic of the united provinces   as federalist no   20   by james madison   shows   such influence appears   however   to have been of a negative nature   as madison describes the dutch confederacy as exhibiting    imbecility in the government   discord among the provinces   foreign influence and indignities   a precarious existence in peace   and peculiar calamities from war      apart from this   the american declaration of independence is similar to the act of abjuration   essentially the declaration of independence of the united provinces   but concrete evidence that the former directly influenced the latter is absent

1907 in the union of utrecht of 20 january 1579   holland and zeeland were granted the right to accept only one religion   in practice   calvinism     every other province had the freedom to regulate the religious question as it wished   although the union stated every person should be free in the choice of personal religion and that no person should be prosecuted based on religious choice   william of orange had been a strong supporter of public and personal freedom of religion and hoped to unite protestants and catholics in the new union   and   for him   the union was a defeat   in practice   catholic services in all provinces were quickly forbidden   and the reformed church became the    public    or    privileged    church in the republic

1908 during the republic   any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the reformed church and take an oath to this effect   the extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders   in the beginning   this was especially focused on roman catholics   being the religion of the enemy   in 17th century leiden   for instance   people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders   a year  s wage for a skilled tradesman   and banned from the city   throughout this   however   personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor   along with economic reasons   in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of europe
what did any person who wanted to hold public office need to conform to during the republic	the reformed church	15	17
1909 in the first years of the republic   controversy arose within the reformed church   mainly around the subject of predestination   this has become known as the struggle between arminianism and gomarism   or between remonstrants and contra remonstrants   in 1618 the synod of dort tackled this issue   which led to the banning of the remonstrant faith
what was the main subject of controversy that arose within the reformed church during the beginning of the republic	predestination	18	18
1910 beginning in the 18th century   the situation changed from more or less active persecution of religious services to a state of restricted toleration of other religions   as long as their services took place secretly in private churches
when did the active persecution of religious services become more of a restricted tolerance	in the 18th century	1	4
1911 symbiosis   from greek        together    and           living      is close and often long term interaction between two different biological species   in 1877 albert bernhard frank used the word symbiosis   which previously had been used to depict people living together in community   to describe the mutualistic relationship in lichens   in 1879   the german mycologist heinrich anton de bary defined it as    the living together of unlike organisms
what language does the word    symbiosis    come from	greek	2	2
1912 the definition of symbiosis has varied among scientists   some believe symbiosis should only refer to persistent mutualisms   while others believe it should apply to any type of persistent biological interaction   in other words mutualistic   commensalistic   or parasitic     after 130 years of debate   current biology and ecology textbooks now use the latter    de bary    definition or an even broader definition   where symbiosis means all species interactions     with the restrictive definition no longer used   in other words   symbiosis means mutualism
how long did it take for scientists to stop using the narrow definition of symbiosis	130 years	38	39
1913 some symbiotic relationships are obligate   meaning that both symbionts entirely depend on each other for survival   for example   many lichens consist of fungal and photosynthetic symbionts that can not live on their own   others are facultative   optional     they can   but do not have to live with the other organism
what is the type of symbiotic relationship where two organisms ca n t survive without each other	obligate	4	4
1914 symbiotic relationships include those associations in which one organism lives on another   ectosymbiosis   such as mistletoe     or where one partner lives inside the other   endosymbiosis   such as lactobacilli and other bacteria in humans or symbiodinium in corals     symbiosis is also classified by physical attachment of the organisms   symbiosis in which the organisms have bodily union is called conjunctive symbiosis   and symbiosis in which they are not in union is called disjunctive symbiosis
what is an example of ectosymbiosis	mistletoe	15	15
1915 endosymbiosis is any symbiotic relationship in which one symbiont lives within the tissues of the other   either within the cells or extracellularly   examples include diverse microbiomes   rhizobia   nitrogen fixing bacteria that live in root nodules on legume roots   actinomycete nitrogen fixing bacteria called frankia   which live in alder tree root nodules   single celled algae inside reef building corals   and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10    15   of insects
what do bacterial endosymbionts give necessary nutrition to	insects	70	70
1916 ectosymbiosis   also referred to as exosymbiosis   is any symbiotic relationship in which the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host   including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands   examples of this include ectoparasites such as lice   commensal ectosymbionts such as the barnacles that attach themselves to the jaw of baleen whales   and mutualist ectosymbionts such as cleaner fish
what organisms are described as living on the surface of whales	barnacles	49	49
1917 mutualism or interspecies reciprocal altruism is a relationship between individuals of different species where both individuals benefit   in general   only lifelong interactions involving close physical and biochemical contact can properly be considered symbiotic   mutualistic relationships may be either obligate for both species   obligate for one but facultative for the other   or facultative for both   many biologists restrict the definition of symbiosis to close mutualist relationships
what is another term for mutualism	interspecies reciprocal altruism	2	4
1918 a large percentage of herbivores have mutualistic gut flora that help them digest plant matter   which is more difficult to digest than animal prey   this gut flora is made up of cellulose digesting protozoans or bacteria living in the herbivores   intestines   coral reefs are the result of mutualisms between coral organisms and various types of algae that live inside them   most land plants and land ecosystems rely on mutualisms between the plants   which fix carbon from the air   and mycorrhyzal fungi   which help in extracting water and minerals from the ground
what type of relationship do herbivores have with the bacteria in their intestines	mutualistic	6	6
1919 an example of mutual symbiosis is the relationship between the ocellaris clownfish that dwell among the tentacles of ritteri sea anemones   the territorial fish protects the anemone from anemone eating fish   and in turn the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from its predators   a special mucus on the clownfish protects it from the stinging tentacles
what lives with ritteri sea anemones	ocellaris clownfish	10	11
1920 a further example is the goby fish   which sometimes lives together with a shrimp   the shrimp digs and cleans up a burrow in the sand in which both the shrimp and the goby fish live   the shrimp is almost blind   leaving it vulnerable to predators when outside its burrow   in case of danger the goby fish touches the shrimp with its tail to warn it   when that happens both the shrimp and goby fish quickly retreat into the burrow   different species of gobies   elacatinus spp     also exhibit mutualistic behavior through cleaning up ectoparasites in other fish
what species does this shrimp have a relationship with	the goby fish	4	6
1921 another non obligate symbiosis is known from encrusting bryozoans and hermit crabs that live in a close relationship   the bryozoan colony   acanthodesia commensale   develops a cirumrotatory growth and offers the crab   pseudopagurus granulimanus   a helicospiral tubular extension of its living chamber that initially was situated within a gastropod shell
what type of symbiosis seen between bryozoans and hermit crabs	non obligate	1	2
1922 one of the most spectacular examples of obligate mutualism is between the siboglinid tube worms and symbiotic bacteria that live at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps   the worm has no digestive tract and is wholly reliant on its internal symbionts for nutrition   the bacteria oxidize either hydrogen sulfide or methane   which the host supplies to them   these worms were discovered in the late 1980s at the hydrothermal vents near the galapagos islands and have since been found at deep sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps in all of the world  s oceans
when were the worms found	the late 1980s	61	63
1923 during mutualistic symbioses   the host cell lacks some of the nutrients   which are provided by the endosymbiont   as a result   the host favors endosymbiont  s growth processes within itself by producing some specialized cells   these cells affect the genetic composition of the host in order to regulate the increasing population of the endosymbionts and ensuring that these genetic changes are passed onto the offspring via vertical transmission   heredity
what is given to the host cell	nutrients	10	10
1924 adaptation of the endosymbiont to the host  s lifestyle leads to many changes in the endosymbiont the foremost being drastic reduction in its genome size   this is due to many genes being lost during the process of metabolism   and dna repair and recombination   while important genes participating in the dna to rna transcription   protein translation and dna rna replication are retained   that is   a decrease in genome size is due to loss of protein coding genes and not due to lessening of inter genic regions or open reading frame   orf   size   thus   species that are naturally evolving and contain reduced sizes of genes can be accounted for an increased number of noticeable differences between them   thereby leading to changes in their evolutionary rates   as the endosymbiotic bacteria related with these insects are passed on to the offspring strictly via vertical genetic transmission   intracellular bacteria goes through many hurdles during the process   resulting in the decrease in effective population sizes when compared to the free living bacteria   this incapability of the endosymbiotic bacteria to reinstate its wild type phenotype via a recombination process is called as muller  s ratchet phenomenon   muller  s ratchet phenomenon together with less effective population sizes has led to an accretion of deleterious mutations in the non essential genes of the intracellular bacteria   this could have been due to lack of selection mechanisms prevailing in the rich environment of the host
what is the main alteration in an endosymbiont when it adapts to a host	drastic reduction in its genome size	19	24
1925 commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped   it is derived from the english word commensal used of human social interaction   the word derives from the medieval latin word   formed from com  and mensa   meaning    sharing a table
what language do the roots of    commensal    come from	latin	39	39
1926 commensal relationships may involve one organism using another for transportation   phoresy   or for housing   inquilinism     or it may also involve one organism using something another created   after its death   metabiosis     examples of metabiosis are hermit crabs using gastropod shells to protect their bodies and spiders building their webs on plants
what is the term for a relationship where one organism provides a dwelling for the other	inquilinism	14	14
1927 a parasitic relationship is one in which one member of the association benefits while the other is harmed   this is also known as antagonistic or antipathetic symbiosis   parasitic symbioses take many forms   from endoparasites that live within the host  s body to ectoparasites that live on its surface   in addition   parasites may be necrotrophic   which is to say they kill their host   or biotrophic   meaning they rely on their host  s surviving   biotrophic parasitism is an extremely successful mode of life   depending on the definition used   as many as half of all animals have at least one parasitic phase in their life cycles   and it is also frequent in plants and fungi   moreover   almost all free living animals are host to one or more parasite taxa   an example of a biotrophic relationship would be a tick feeding on the blood of its host
antagonistic or antipathetic symbiosis are alternate names for what	a parasitic relationship	0	2
1928 amensalism is the type of relationship that exists where one species is inhibited or completely obliterated and one is unaffected   this type of symbiosis is relatively uncommon in rudimentary reference texts   but is omnipresent in the natural world     citation needed   there are two types of amensalism   competition and antibiosis   competition is where a larger or stronger organisms deprives a smaller or weaker one from a resource   antibiosis occurs when one organism is damaged or killed by another through a chemical secretion   an example of competition is a sapling growing under the shadow of a mature tree   the mature tree can begin to rob the sapling of necessary sunlight and   if the mature tree is very large   it can take up rainwater and deplete soil nutrients   throughout the process the mature tree is unaffected   indeed   if the sapling dies   the mature tree gains nutrients from the decaying sapling   note that these nutrients become available because of the sapling  s decomposition   rather than from the living sapling   which would be a case of parasitism     citation needed   an example of antibiosis is juglans nigra   black walnut     secreting juglone   a substance which destroys many herbaceous plants within its root zone
what is the name for the kind of symbiosis in which one organism is seriously harmed and there is no affect on the other	amensalism	0	0
1929 amensalism is an interaction where an organism inflicts harm to another organism without any costs or benefits received by the other   a clear case of amensalism is where sheep or cattle trample grass   whilst the presence of the grass causes negligible detrimental effects to the animal  s hoof   the grass suffers from being crushed   amensalism is often used to describe strongly asymmetrical competitive interactions   such as has been observed between the spanish ibex and weevils of the genus timarcha which feed upon the same type of shrub   whilst the presence of the weevil has almost no influence on food availability   the presence of ibex has an enormous detrimental effect on weevil numbers   as they consume significant quantities of plant matter and incidentally ingest the weevils upon it
what organisms is the ibex in an amensalistic relationship with	weevils	74	74
1930 synnecrosis is a rare type of symbiosis in which the interaction between species is detrimental to both organisms involved   it is a short lived condition   as the interaction eventually causes death   because of this   evolution selects against synnecrosis and it is uncommon in nature   an example of this is the relationship between some species of bees and victims of the bee sting   species of bees who die after stinging their prey inflict pain on themselves   albeit to protect the hive   as well as on the victim   this term is rarely used
what type of relationship harms both organisms	synnecrosis	0	0
1931 while historically   symbiosis has received less attention than other interactions such as predation or competition   it is increasingly recognized as an important selective force behind evolution   with many species having a long history of interdependent co evolution   in fact   the evolution of all eukaryotes   plants   animals   fungi   and protists   is believed under the endosymbiotic theory to have resulted from a symbiosis between various sorts of bacteria   this theory is supported by certain organelles dividing independently of the cell   and the observation that some organelles seem to have their own nucleic acid
what far reaching result do scientists think has come about from symbiosis with bacteria	the evolution of all eukaryotes	39	43
1932 the biologist lynn margulis   famous for her work on endosymbiosis   contends that symbiosis is a major driving force behind evolution   she considers darwin  s notion of evolution   driven by competition   to be incomplete and claims that evolution is strongly based on co operation   interaction   and mutual dependence among organisms   according to margulis and dorion sagan      life did not take over the globe by combat   but by networking
what does margulis think is the main driver of evolution	symbiosis	12	12
1933 symbiosis played a major role in the co evolution of flowering plants and the animals that pollinate them   many plants that are pollinated by insects   bats   or birds have highly specialized flowers modified to promote pollination by a specific pollinator that is also correspondingly adapted   the first flowering plants in the fossil record had relatively simple flowers   adaptive speciation quickly gave rise to many diverse groups of plants   and   at the same time   corresponding speciation occurred in certain insect groups   some groups of plants developed nectar and large sticky pollen   while insects evolved more specialized morphologies to access and collect these rich food sources   in some taxa of plants and insects the relationship has become dependent   where the plant species can only be pollinated by one species of insect

1937 during the cold war   a principal focus of canadian defence policy was contributing to the security of europe in the face of the soviet military threat   toward that end   canadian ground and air forces were based in europe from the early 1950s until the early 1990s
what war were the caf involved in	cold war	2	3
1938 however   since the end of the cold war   as the north atlantic treaty organization   nato   has moved much of its defence focus    out of area      the canadian military has also become more deeply engaged in international security operations in various other parts of the world   most notably in afghanistan since 2002

1941 prior to confederation in 1867   residents of the colonies in what is now canada served as regular members of french and british forces and in local militia groups   the latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other european powers   aboriginal peoples   and later american forces during the american revolutionary war and war of 1812   as well as in the fenian raids   red river rebellion   and north west rebellion   consequently   the lineages of some canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century   when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of british north america against invasion by the united states
what year was canada united in a confederation	1867	4	4
1942 the responsibility for military command remained with the british crown in council   with a commander in chief for north america stationed at halifax until the final withdrawal of british army and royal navy units from that city in 1906  thereafter   the royal canadian navy was formed   and   with the advent of military aviation   the royal canadian air force   these forces were organised under the department of militia and defence   and split into the permanent and non permanent active militias frequently shortened to simply the militia   by 1923   the department was merged into the department of national defence   but land forces in canada were not referred to as the canadian army until november 1940
who initially had military command	the british crown in council	7	11
1943 the first overseas deployment of canadian military forces occurred during the second boer war   when several units were raised to serve under british command   similarly   when the united kingdom entered into conflict with germany in the first world war   canadian troops were called to participate in european theatres   the canadian crown in council then decided to send its forces into the second world war   as well as the korean war

1944 since 1947   canadian military units have participated in more than 200 operations worldwide   and completed 72 international operations   canadian soldiers   sailors   and aviators came to be considered world class professionals through conspicuous service during these conflicts and the country  s integral participation in nato during the cold war   first gulf war   kosovo war   and in united nations peacekeeping operations   such as the suez crisis   golan heights   cyprus   croatia   bosnia   afghanistan   and libya   canada maintained an aircraft carrier from 1957 to 1970 during the cold war   which never saw combat but participated in patrols during the cuban missile crisis
how many operations has the canadian military been part of since 1947	more than 200 operations	8	11
1945 battles which are particularly notable to the canadian military include the battle of vimy ridge   the dieppe raid   the battle of ortona   the battle of passchendaele   the normandy landings   the battle for caen   the battle of the scheldt   the battle of britain   the battle of the atlantic   the strategic bombing of german cities   and more recently the battle of medak pocket   in croatia

1947 the current iteration of the canadian armed forces dates from 1 february 1968   when the royal canadian navy   canadian army   and royal canadian air force were merged into a unified structure and superseded by elemental commands   its roots   however   lie in colonial militia groups that served alongside garrisons of the french and british armies and navies   a structure that remained in place until the early 20th century   thereafter   a distinctly canadian army and navy was established   followed by an air force   that   because of the constitutional arrangements at the time   remained effectively under the control of the british government until canada gained legislative independence from the united kingdom in 1931   in part due to the distinguished achievement and sacrifice of the canadian corps in the first world war

1950 the armed forces are today funded by approximately   20 1 billion annually and are presently ranked 74th in size compared to the world  s other armed forces by number of total personnel   and 58th in terms of active personnel   standing at a strength of roughly 68 000   plus 27 000 reservists   5000 rangers   and 19 000 supplementary reserves   bringing the total force to approximately 119 000  the number of primary reserve personnel is expected to go up to 30 000 by 2020   and the number of active to at least 70 000  in addition   5000 rangers and 19 000 supplementary personnel will be serving   if this happens the total strength would be around 124 000  these individuals serve on numerous cf bases located in all regions of the country   and are governed by the queen  s regulations and orders and the national defence act
what is today  s annual cost of the canadian forces	approximately   20 1 billion	7	10
1951 in 2008 the government of canada made efforts   through the canada first defence strategy   to modernize the canadian armed forces   through the purchase of new equipment   improved training and readiness   as well as the establishment of the canadian special operations regiment   more funds were also put towards recruitment   which had been dwindling throughout the 1980s and  90s   possibly because the canadian populace had come to perceive the caf as peacekeepers rather than as soldiers   as shown in a 2008 survey conducted for the department of national defence   the poll found that nearly two thirds of canadians agreed with the country  s participation in the invasion of afghanistan   and that the military should be stronger   but also that the purpose of the forces should be different   such as more focused on responding to natural disasters   then cds   walter natynczyk   said later that year that while recruiting has become more successful   the cf was facing a problem with its rate of loss of existing members   which increased between 2006 and 2008 from 6   to 9 2   annually

2033 conventionally   iranian languages are grouped in    western    and    eastern    branches   these terms have little meaning with respect to old avestan as that stage of the language may predate the settling of the iranian peoples into western and eastern groups   the geographic terms also have little meaning when applied to younger avestan since it is n t known where that dialect   or dialects   was spoken either   certain is only that avestan   all forms   and old persian are distinct   and since old persian is    western      and avestan was not old persian   avestan acquired a default assignment to    eastern      confusing the issue is the introduction of a western iranian substrate in later avestan compositions and redactions undertaken at the centers of imperial power in western iran   either in the south west in persia   or in the north west in nisa parthia and ecbatana media

2050 an important property of light fixtures is the luminous efficacy or wall plug efficiency   meaning the amount of usable light emanating from the fixture per used energy   usually measured in lumen per watt   a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the    bulb    to the surroundings   the more transparent the lighting fixture is   the higher efficacy   shading the light will normally decrease efficacy but increase the directionality and the visual comfort probability
luminous efficacy is measure in what unit	lumen per watt	30	32
2051 color temperature for white light sources also affects their use for certain applications   the color temperature of a white light source is the temperature in kelvin of a theoretical black body emitter that most closely matches the spectral characteristics of the lamp   an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvin   daylight is around 6400 kelvin   lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum   while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue white appearance   for critical inspection or color matching tasks   or for retail displays of food and clothing   the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect

2069 measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source   along with the colors that can be rendered by this light   the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum   therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light   the basic si unit of measurement is the candela   cd     which describes the luminous intensity   all other photometric units are derived from the candela   luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction   it describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area   and falls within a given solid angle   the si unit for luminance is candela per square metre   cd m2     the cgs unit of luminance is the stilb   which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd m2   the amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen   lm
what is the basic si unit of measurement	candela   cd	80	81
2070 the si unit of illuminance and luminous emittance   being the luminous power per area   is measured in lux   it is used in photometry as a measure of the intensity   as perceived by the human eye   of light that hits or passes through a surface   it is analogous to the radiometric unit watts per square metre   but with the power at each wavelength weighted according to the luminosity function   a standardized model of human visual brightness perception   in english      lux    is used in both singular and plural

2071 several measurement methods have been developed to control glare resulting from indoor lighting design   the unified glare rating   ugr     the visual comfort probability   and the daylight glare index are some of the most well known methods of measurement   in addition to these new methods   four main factors influence the degree of discomfort glare   the luminance of the glare source   the solid angle of the glare source   the background luminance   and the position of the glare source in the field of view must all be taken into account
what does ugr stand for	unified glare rating	15	17
2072 to define light source color properties   the lighting industry predominantly relies on two metrics   correlated color temperature   cct     commonly used as an indication of the apparent    warmth    or    coolness    of the light emitted by a source   and color rendering index   cri     an indication of the light source s ability to make objects appear natural
what does cct stand for	correlated color temperature	14	16
2073 for example   in order to meet the expectations for good color rendering in retail applications   research suggests using the well established cri along with another metric called gamut area index   gai     gai represents the relative separation of object colors illuminated by a light source   the greater the gai   the greater the apparent saturation or vividness of the object colors   as a result   light sources which balance both cri and gai are generally preferred over ones that have only high cri or only high gai

2112 courts check both the executive branch and the legislative branch through judicial review   this concept is not written into the constitution   but was envisioned by many of the constitution  s framers   for example   the federalist papers mention it     the supreme court established a precedent for judicial review in marbury v  madison   there were protests by some at this decision   born chiefly of political expediency   but political realities in the particular case paradoxically restrained opposing views from asserting themselves   for this reason   precedent alone established the principle that a court may strike down a law it deems unconstitutional

2117 throughout america  s history dominance of one of the three branches has essentially been a see saw struggle between congress and the president   both have had periods of great power and weakness such as immediately after the civil war when republicans had a majority in congress and were able to pass major legislation and shoot down most of the president  s vetoes   they also passed acts to essentially make the president subordinate to congress   such as the tenure of office act   johnson  s later impeachment also cost the presidency much political power   however the president has also exercised greater power largely during the 20th century   both roosevelts greatly expanded the powers of the president and wielded great power during their terms

2119 some of jackson  s successors made no use of the veto power   while others used it intermittently   it was only after the civil war that presidents began to use the power to truly counterbalance congress   andrew johnson   a democrat   vetoed several reconstruction bills passed by the    radical republicans      congress   however   managed to override fifteen of johnson  s twenty nine vetoes   furthermore   it attempted to curb the power of the presidency by passing the tenure of office act   the act required senate approval for the dismissal of senior cabinet officials   when johnson deliberately violated the act   which he felt was unconstitutional   supreme court decisions later vindicated such a position     the house of representatives impeached him   he was acquitted in the senate by one vote

2120 johnson  s impeachment was perceived to have done great damage to the presidency   which came to be almost subordinate to congress   some believed that the president would become a mere figurehead   with the speaker of the house of representatives becoming a de facto prime minister   grover cleveland   the first democratic president following johnson   attempted to restore the power of his office   during his first term   he vetoed over four hundred bills twice as many bills as his twenty one predecessors combined   he also began to suspend bureaucrats who were appointed as a result of the patronage system   replacing them with more    deserving    individuals   the senate   however   refused to confirm many new nominations   instead demanding that cleveland turn over the confidential records relating to the suspensions   cleveland steadfastly refused   asserting      these suspensions are my executive acts     i am not responsible to the senate   and i am unwilling to submit my actions to them for judgment      cleveland  s popular support forced the senate to back down and confirm the nominees   furthermore   congress finally repealed the controversial tenure of office act that had been passed during the johnson administration   overall   this meant that cleveland  s administration marked the end of presidential subordination

2121 several twentieth century presidents have attempted to greatly expand the power of the presidency   theodore roosevelt   for instance   claimed that the president was permitted to do whatever was not explicitly prohibited by the law in direct contrast to his immediate successor   william howard taft   franklin delano roosevelt held considerable power during the great depression   congress had granted franklin roosevelt sweeping authority   in panama refining v  ryan   the court for the first time struck down a congressional delegation of power as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers   the aforementioned schechter poultry corp  v  united states   another separation of powers case   was also decided during franklin roosevelt  s presidency   in response to many unfavorable supreme court decisions   roosevelt introduced a    court packing    plan   under which more seats would be added to the supreme court for the president to fill   such a plan   which was defeated in congress   would have seriously undermined the judiciary  s independence and power

2122 richard nixon used national security as a basis for his expansion of power   he asserted   for example   that    the inherent power of the president to safeguard the security of the nation    authorized him to order a wiretap without a judge  s warrant   nixon also asserted that    executive privilege    shielded him from all legislative oversight   furthermore   he impounded federal funds   that is to say   he refused to spend money that congress had appropriated for government programs     in the specific cases aforementioned   however   the supreme court ruled against nixon   this was also because of an ongoing criminal investigation into the watergate tapes   even though they acknowledged the general need for executive privilege   since then   nixon  s successors have sometimes asserted that they may act in the interests of national security or that executive privilege shields them from congressional oversight   though such claims have in general been more limited than nixon  s   one may still conclude that the presidency  s power has been greatly augmented since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries

2123 it is said   by whom     on one side of this debate that separation of powers means that powers are shared among different branches   no one branch may act unilaterally on issues   other than perhaps minor questions     but must obtain some form of agreement across branches   that is   it is argued that    checks and balances    apply to the judicial branch as well as to the other branches

2124 an example of the first view is the regulation of attorneys and judges   and the establishment of rules for the conduct of the courts   by the congress and in the states the legislatures   although in practice these matters are delegated to the supreme court   the congress holds these powers and delegates them to the supreme court only for convenience in light of the supreme court  s expertise   but can withdraw that delegation at any time

2125 an example of the second view at the state level is found in the view of the florida supreme court   that only the florida supreme court may license and regulate attorneys appearing before the courts of florida   and only the florida supreme court may set rules for procedures in the florida courts     citation needed   the state of new hampshire also follows this system     citation needed

2128 according to vitruvius   the architect should strive to fulfill each of these three attributes as well as possible   leon battista alberti   who elaborates on the ideas of vitruvius in his treatise   de re aedificatoria   saw beauty primarily as a matter of proportion   although ornament also played a part   for alberti   the rules of proportion were those that governed the idealised human figure   the golden mean   the most important aspect of beauty was therefore an inherent part of an object   rather than something applied superficially   and was based on universal   recognisable truths   the notion of style in the arts was not developed until the 16th century   with the writing of vasari   by the 18th century   his lives of the most excellent painters   sculptors   and architects had been translated into italian   french   spanish and english

2133 while the notion that structural and aesthetic considerations should be entirely subject to functionality was met with both popularity and skepticism   it had the effect of introducing the concept of    function    in place of vitruvius      utility         function    came to be seen as encompassing all criteria of the use   perception and enjoyment of a building   not only practical but also aesthetic   psychological and cultural

2144 architecture has to do with planning and designing form   space and ambience to reflect functional   technical   social   environmental and aesthetic considerations   it requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology   and of light and shadow   often   conflicting requirements must be resolved   the practice of architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures   including scheduling   cost estimation and construction administration   documentation produced by architects   typically drawings   plans and technical specifications   defines the structure and or behavior of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed

2151 with the emerging knowledge in scientific fields and the rise of new materials and technology   architecture and engineering began to separate   and the architect began to concentrate on aesthetics and the humanist aspects   often at the expense of technical aspects of building design   there was also the rise of the    gentleman architect    who usually dealt with wealthy clients and concentrated predominantly on visual qualities derived usually from historical prototypes   typified by the many country houses of great britain that were created in the neo gothic or scottish baronial styles   formal architectural training in the 19th century   for example at  cole des beaux arts in france   gave much emphasis to the production of beautiful drawings and little to context and feasibility   effective architects generally received their training in the offices of other architects   graduating to the role from draughtsmen or clerks

2155 when modern architecture was first practiced   it was an avant garde movement with moral   philosophical   and aesthetic underpinnings   immediately after world war i   pioneering modernist architects sought to develop a completely new style appropriate for a new post war social and economic order   focused on meeting the needs of the middle and working classes   they rejected the architectural practice of the academic refinement of historical styles which served the rapidly declining aristocratic order   the approach of the modernist architects was to reduce buildings to pure forms   removing historical references and ornament in favor of functionalist details   buildings displayed their functional and structural elements   exposing steel beams and concrete surfaces instead of hiding them behind decorative forms

2159 one such reaction to the cold aesthetic of modernism and brutalism is the school of metaphoric architecture   which includes such things as biomorphism and zoomorphic architecture   both using nature as the primary source of inspiration and design   while it is considered by some to be merely an aspect of postmodernism   others consider it to be a school in its own right and a later development of expressionist architecture

2160 beginning in the late 1950s and 1960s   architectural phenomenology emerged as an important movement in the early reaction against modernism   with architects like charles moore in the usa   christian norberg schulz in norway   and ernesto nathan rogers and vittorio gregotti in italy   who collectively popularized an interest in a new contemporary architecture aimed at expanding human experience using historical buildings as models and precedents   postmodernism produced a style that combined contemporary building technology and cheap materials   with the aesthetics of older pre modern and non modern styles   from high classical architecture to popular or vernacular regional building styles   robert venturi famously defined postmodern architecture as a    decorated shed      an ordinary building which is functionally designed inside and embellished on the outside     and upheld it against modernist and brutalist    ducks      buildings with unnecessarily expressive tectonic forms

2161 since the 1980s   as the complexity of buildings began to increase   in terms of structural systems   services   energy and technologies     the field of architecture became multi disciplinary with specializations for each project type   technological expertise or project delivery methods   in addition   there has been an increased separation of the  design   architect   notes 1   from the  project   architect who ensures that the project meets the required standards and deals with matters of liability     notes 2   the preparatory processes for the design of any large building have become increasingly complicated   and require preliminary studies of such matters as durability   sustainability   quality   money   and compliance with local laws   a large structure can no longer be the design of one person but must be the work of many   modernism and postmodernism have been criticised by some members of the architectural profession who feel that successful architecture is not a personal   philosophical   or aesthetic pursuit by individualists   rather it has to consider everyday needs of people and use technology to create liveable environments   with the design process being informed by studies of behavioral   environmental   and social sciences
about when did architecture begin specializing	since the 1980s	0	2
2162 environmental sustainability has become a mainstream issue   with profound effect on the architectural profession   many developers   those who support the financing of buildings   have become educated to encourage the facilitation of environmentally sustainable design   rather than solutions based primarily on immediate cost   major examples of this can be found in passive solar building design   greener roof designs   biodegradable materials   and more attention to a structure  s energy usage   this major shift in architecture has also changed architecture schools to focus more on the environment   sustainability in architecture was pioneered by frank lloyd wright   in the 1960s by buckminster fuller and in the 1970s by architects such as ian mcharg and sim van der ryn in the us and brenda and robert vale in the uk and new zealand   there has been an acceleration in the number of buildings which seek to meet green building sustainable design principles   sustainable practices that were at the core of vernacular architecture increasingly provide inspiration for environmentally and socially sustainable contemporary techniques   the u s  green building council  s leed   leadership in energy and environmental design   rating system has been instrumental in this

2163 concurrently   the recent movements of new urbanism   metaphoric architecture and new classical architecture promote a sustainable approach towards construction   that appreciates and develops smart growth   architectural tradition and classical design   this in contrast to modernist and globally uniform architecture   as well as leaning against solitary housing estates and suburban sprawl

2166 the origins of the hdi are found in the annual development reports of the united nations development programme   undp     these were devised and launched by pakistani economist mahbub ul haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose    to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people centered policies      to produce the human development reports   mahbub ul haq formed a group of development economists including paul streeten   frances stewart   gustav ranis   keith griffin   sudhir anand   and meghnad desai   working alongside nobel laureate amartya sen   they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework   haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public   academics   and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well being   sen initially opposed this idea   but he soon went on to help haq develop the index   sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index   but haq persuaded him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well being

2444 in other contexts the term does not necessarily have pejorative overtones and may even be complimentary when used   in areas where innovation is welcome   of ideas that are in fundamental disagreement with the status quo in any practice and branch of knowledge   scientist author isaac asimov considered heresy as an abstraction   asimov  s views are in forward   the role of the heretic   mentioning religious   political   socioeconomic and scientific heresies   he divided scientific heretics into endoheretics   those from within the scientific community   and exoheretics   those from without     characteristics were ascribed to both and examples of both kinds were offered   asimov concluded that science orthodoxy defends itself well against endoheretics   by control of science education   grants and publication as examples     but is nearly powerless against exoheretics   he acknowledged by examples that heresy has repeatedly become orthodoxy
what must be welcomed in areas for the term do be perceived as complimentary	innovation	21	21
2445 the revisionist paleontologist robert t  bakker   who published his findings as the dinosaur heresies   treated the mainstream view of dinosaurs as dogma      i have enormous respect for dinosaur paleontologists past and present   but on average   for the last fifty years   the field has n t tested dinosaur orthodoxy severely enough      page 27    most taxonomists   however   have viewed such new terminology as dangerously destabilizing to the traditional and well known scheme        page 462  this book apparently influenced jurassic park   the illustrations by the author show dinosaurs in very active poses   in contrast to the traditional perception of lethargy   he is an example of a recent scientific endoheretic
what is the title of the book published by robert t  bakker regarding mainstream opinion of dinosaurs	the dinosaur heresies	11	13
2446 immanuel velikovsky is an example of a recent scientific exoheretic   he did not have appropriate scientific credentials or did not publish in scientific journals   while the details of his work are in scientific disrepute   the concept of catastrophic change   extinction event and punctuated equilibrium   has gained acceptance in recent decades
what label is associated with immanuel velikovsky due to his works outside the accepted discipline	exoheretic	9	9
2447 the term heresy is also used as an ideological pigeonhole for contemporary writers because   by definition   heresy depends on contrasts with an established orthodoxy   for example   the tongue in cheek contemporary usage of heresy   such as to categorize a    wall street heresy    a    democratic heresy    or a    republican heresy      are metaphors that invariably retain a subtext that links orthodoxies in geology or biology or any other field to religion   these expanded metaphoric senses allude to both the difference between the person  s views and the mainstream and the boldness of such a person in propounding these views
by definition   what contrast does heresy depend on	an established orthodoxy	21	23
2448 the warsaw pact   formally   the treaty of friendship   co operation   and mutual assistance   sometimes   informally warpac   akin in format to nato   was a collective defense treaty among soviet union and seven soviet satellite states in central and eastern europe in existence during the cold war   the warsaw pact was the military complement to the council for mutual economic assistance   comecon     the regional economic organization for the communist states of central and eastern europe   the warsaw pact was created in reaction to the integration of west germany into nato in 1955 per the paris pacts of 1954   but it is also considered to have been motivated by soviet desires to maintain control over military forces in central and eastern europe
in which year was the warsaw pact established	1955	89	89
2449 while the warsaw pact was established as a balance of power or counterweight to nato   there was no direct confrontation between them   instead   the conflict was fought on an ideological basis   both nato and the warsaw pact led to the expansion of military forces and their integration into the respective blocs   the warsaw pact  s largest military engagement was warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia   with the participation of all pact nations except romania and albania     the pact failed to function when the revolutions of 1989 spread through eastern europe   beginning with the solidarity movement in poland and its success in june 1989
which organization was in direct competition with the warsaw pact	nato	14	14
2450 on 25 february 1991   the pact was declared at an end at a meeting of defense and foreign ministers from the remaining member states meeting in hungary   on 1 july 1991   the czechoslovak president v clav havel formally declared an end to the warsaw treaty organization of friendship   co operation   and mutual assistance which had been established in 1955  the ussr itself was dissolved in december 1991
in which country did the warsaw pact dissolution meeting take place	hungary	26	26
2451 the warsaw treaty  s organization was two fold   the political consultative committee handled political matters   and the combined command of pact armed forces controlled the assigned multi national forces   with headquarters in warsaw   poland   furthermore   the supreme commander of the unified armed forces of the warsaw treaty organization which commands and controls all the military forces of the member countries was also a first deputy minister of defense of the ussr   and the chief of combined staff of the unified armed forces of the warsaw treaty organization was also a first deputy chief of the general staff of the armed forces of the ussr   therefore   although ostensibly an international collective security alliance   the ussr dominated the warsaw treaty armed forces
despite being headquartered in poland   the top ranking operatives of the warsaw pact were from which country	the ussr	69	70
2452 the strategy behind the formation of the warsaw pact was driven by the desire of the soviet union to dominate central and eastern europe   this policy was driven by ideological and geostrategic reasons   ideologically   the soviet union arrogated the right to define socialism and communism and act as the leader of the global socialist movement   a corollary to this idea was the necessity of intervention if a country appeared to be violating core socialist ideas and communist party functions   which was explicitly stated in the brezhnev doctrine   geostrategic principles also drove the soviet union to prevent invasion of its territory by western european powers
which ideologies did the soviet union aspire to lead around the globe	socialism and communism	42	44
2453 before creation of warsaw pact   fearing germany rearmed   czechoslovak leadership sought to create security pact with east germany and poland   these states protested strongly against re militarization of west germany   the warsaw pact was primarily put in place as a consequence of the rearming of west germany inside nato   soviet leaders   as many european countries in both western and eastern side   feared germany being once again a military power as a direct threat and german militarism remained a fresh memory among soviets and eastern europeans   as soviet union had already bilateral treaties with all of its eastern satellites   the pact has been long considered  superfluous     and because of the rushed way in which it was conceived   nato officials labeled it as a  cardboard castle     previously   in march 1954   the ussr   fearing the restoration of german militarism in west germany   requested admission to nato
the formation of the warsaw pact was driven by fears of which country rearming itself	west germany	28	29
2454 the soviet request to join nato arose in the aftermath of the berlin conference of january february 1954  soviet foreign minister molotov made proposals to have germany reunified and elections for a pan german government   under conditions of withdrawal of the four powers armies and german neutrality   but all were refused by the other foreign ministers   dulles   usa     eden   uk   and bidault   france     proposals for the reunification of germany were nothing new   earlier on 20 march 1952   talks about a german reunification   initiated by the socalled  stalin note     ended after the united kingdom   france   and the united states insisted that a unified germany should not be neutral and should be free to join the european defence community and rearm   james dunn   usa     who met in paris with eden   adenauer and robert schuman   france     affirmed that    the object should be to avoid discussion with the russians and to press on the european defense community      according to john gaddis    there was little inclination in western capitals to explore this offer    from ussr   while historian rolf steininger asserts that adenauer  s conviction that  neutralization means sovietization  was the main factor in the rejection of the soviet proposals   adenauer also feared that unification might have resulted in the end of the cdu  s dominance in the bundestag
who was the soviet minister who proposed german reunification	molotov	21	21
2455 one month later   the proposed european treaty was rejected not only by supporters of the edc but also by western opponents of the european defense community   like french gaullist leader palewski   who perceived it as    unacceptable in its present form because it excludes the usa from participation in the collective security system in europe      the soviets then decided to make a new proposal to the governments of the usa   uk and france stating to accept the participation of the usa in the proposed general european agreement   and considering that another argument deployed against the soviet proposal was that it was perceived by western powers as    directed against the north atlantic pact and its liquidation      the soviets decided to declare their    readiness to examine jointly with other interested parties the question of the participation of the ussr in the north atlantic bloc      specifying that    the admittance of the usa into the general european agreement should not be conditional on the three western powers agreeing to the ussr joining the north atlantic pact
the omission of which nation from involvement in the proposed security system led to its nato opposition	the usa	43	44
2456 again all proposals   including the request to join nato   were rejected by uk   us   and french governments shortly after   emblematic was the position of british general hastings ismay   supporter of nato expansion   who said that nato    must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella      he opposed the request to join nato made by the ussr in 1954 saying that    the soviet request to join nato is like an unrepentant burglar requesting to join the police force

2457 in april 1954 adenauer made his first visit to the usa meeting nixon   eisenhower and dulles   ratification of edc was delaying but the us representatives made it clear to adenauer that edc would have to become a part of nato
in what year did konrad adenauer first visit the united states	1954	2	2
2458 memories of the nazi occupation were still strong   and the rearmament of germany was feared by france too   on 30 august 1954 french parliament rejected the edc   thus ensuring its failure and blocking a major objective of us policy towards europe   to associate germany militarily with the west   the us department of state started to elaborate alternatives   germany would be invited to join nato or   in the case of french obstructionism   strategies to circumvent a french veto would be implemented in order to obtain a german rearmament outside nato

2459 on 23 october 1954   only nine years after allies   uk   usa and ussr   defeated nazi germany ending world war ii in europe   the admission of the federal republic of germany to the north atlantic pact was finally decided   the incorporation of west germany into the organization on 9 may 1955 was described as    a decisive turning point in the history of our continent    by halvard lange   foreign affairs minister of norway at the time   in november 1954   the ussr requested a new european security treaty   in order to make a final attempt to not have a remilitarized west germany potentially opposed to the soviet union   with no success

2460 on 14 may 1955   the ussr and other seven european countries    reaffirming their desire for the establishment of a system of european collective security based on the participation of all european states irrespective of their social and political systems    established the warsaw pact in response to the integration of the federal republic of germany into nato   declaring that      a remilitarized western germany and the integration of the latter in the north atlantic bloc         increase the danger of another war and constitutes a threat to the national security of the peaceable states           in these circumstances the peaceable european states must take the necessary measures to safeguard their security

2462 the eight member countries of the warsaw pact pledged the mutual defense of any member who would be attacked   relations among the treaty signatories were based upon mutual non intervention in the internal affairs of the member countries   respect for national sovereignty   and political independence   however   almost all governments of those member states were indirectly controlled by the soviet union

2463 in july 1963 the mongolian people  s republic asked to join the warsaw pact under article 9 of the treaty   for this purpose a special protocol should have been taken since the text of the treaty applied only to europe   due to the emerging sino soviet split   mongolia remained on observer status   soviet stationing troops were agreed to stay in mongolia from 1966

2464 for 36 years   nato and the warsaw pact never directly waged war against each other in europe   the united states and the soviet union and their respective allies implemented strategic policies aimed at the containment of each other in europe   while working and fighting for influence within the wider cold war on the international stage

2470 materialism is a form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature   and that all phenomena   including mental phenomena and consciousness   are identical with material interactions
what is materialism	a form of philosophical monism	2	6
2471 materialism is closely related to physicalism   the view that all that exists is ultimately physical   philosophical physicalism has evolved from materialism with the discoveries of the physical sciences to incorporate more sophisticated notions of physicality than mere ordinary matter   such as   spacetime   physical energies and forces   dark matter   and so on   thus the term    physicalism    is preferred over    materialism    by some   while others use the terms as if they are synonymous
what are some examples of philosophical physicalism	spacetime   physical energies and forces   dark matter	41	47
2472 materialism belongs to the class of monist ontology   as such   it is different from ontological theories based on dualism or pluralism   for singular explanations of the phenomenal reality   materialism would be in contrast to idealism   neutral monism   and spiritualism
what class does materialism belong to	monist ontology	6	7
2473 despite the large number of philosophical schools and subtle nuances between many   all philosophies are said to fall into one of two primary categories   which are defined in contrast to each other   idealism   and materialism     a   the basic proposition of these two categories pertains to the nature of reality   and the primary distinction between them is the way they answer two fundamental questions      what does reality consist of      and    how does it originate      to idealists   spirit or mind or the objects of mind   ideas   are primary   and matter secondary   to materialists   matter is primary   and mind or spirit or ideas are secondary   the product of matter acting upon matter
what is the first question to ask in order to define the two classes	what does reality consist of	63	67
2474 the materialist view is perhaps best understood in its opposition to the doctrines of immaterial substance applied to the mind historically   famously by ren  descartes   however   by itself materialism says nothing about how material substance should be characterized   in practice   it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another
was ren  descartes an idealist or a materialist	materialist	1	1
2475 during the 19th century   karl marx and friedrich engels extended the concept of materialism to elaborate a materialist conception of history centered on the roughly empirical world of human activity   practice   including labor   and the institutions created   reproduced   or destroyed by that activity   see materialist conception of history     later marxists developed the notion of dialectical materialism which characterized later marxist philosophy and method
what type of materialism defined the marxist philosophy	dialectical materialism	54	55

2477 in ancient indian philosophy   materialism developed around 600 bc with the works of ajita kesakambali   payasi   kanada   and the proponents of the c rv ka school of philosophy   kanada became one of the early proponents of atomism   the nyaya vaisesika school   600 bc   100 bc   developed one of the earliest forms of atomism   though their proofs of god and their positing that the consciousness was not material precludes labelling them as materialists   buddhist atomism and the jaina school continued the atomic tradition
around what time did materialism become part of ancient indian philosophy	600 bc	7	8
2478 materialism is often associated with reductionism   according to which the objects or phenomena individuated at one level of description   if they are genuine   must be explicable in terms of the objects or phenomena at some other level of description   typically   at a more reduced level   non reductive materialism explicitly rejects this notion   however   taking the material constitution of all particulars to be consistent with the existence of real objects   properties   or phenomena not explicable in the terms canonically used for the basic material constituents   jerry fodor influentially argues this view   according to which empirical laws and explanations in    special sciences    like psychology or geology are invisible from the perspective of basic physics   a lot of vigorous literature has grown up around the relation between these views
materialism is linked to what	reductionism	5	5
2479 ancient greek philosophers like thales   anaxagoras   ca   500 bc   428 bc     epicurus and democritus prefigure later materialists   the latin poem de rerum natura by lucretius   ca   99 bc   ca   55 bc   reflects the mechanistic philosophy of democritus and epicurus   according to this view   all that exists is matter and void   and all phenomena result from different motions and conglomerations of base material particles called    atoms      literally      indivisibles        de rerum natura provides mechanistic explanations for phenomena such as erosion   evaporation   wind   and sound   famous principles like    nothing can touch body but body    first appeared in the works of lucretius   democritus and epicurus however did not hold to a monist ontology since they held to the ontological separation of matter and space i e   space being    another kind    of being   indicating that the definition of    materialism    is wider than given scope for in this article

2483 arthur schopenhauer   1788 1860   wrote that        materialism is the philosophy of the subject who forgets to take account of himself      he claimed that an observing subject can only know material objects through the mediation of the brain and its particular organization   that is   the brain itself is the    determiner    of how material objects will be experienced or perceived

2484 the german materialist and atheist anthropologist ludwig feuerbach would signal a new turn in materialism through his book   the essence of christianity   1841     which provided a humanist account of religion as the outward projection of man  s inward nature   feuerbach  s materialism would later heavily influence karl marx

2485 many current and recent philosophers e g    daniel dennett   willard van orman quine   donald davidson   and jerry fodor operate within a broadly physicalist or materialist framework   producing rival accounts of how best to accommodate mind   including functionalism   anomalous monism   identity theory   and so on
in regards to the mind   what are 3 theories that modern day philosophers try to harmonize	functionalism   anomalous monism   identity theory	36	40
2486 the nature and definition of matter   like other key concepts in science and philosophy   have occasioned much debate   is there a single kind of matter   hyle   which everything is made of   or multiple kinds   is matter a continuous substance capable of expressing multiple forms   hylomorphism     or a number of discrete   unchanging constituents   atomism     does it have intrinsic properties   substance theory     or is it lacking them   prima materia
what is hyle	matter	5	5
2487 one challenge to the traditional concept of matter as tangible    stuff    came with the rise of field physics in the 19th century   relativity shows that matter and energy   including the spatially distributed energy of fields   are interchangeable   this enables the ontological view that energy is prima materia and matter is one of its forms   on the other hand   the standard model of particle physics uses quantum field theory to describe all interactions   on this view it could be said that fields are prima materia and the energy is a property of the field
relativity illustrates that what is interchangeable	matter and energy	25	27
2488 according to the dominant cosmological model   the lambda cdm model   less than 5   of the universe  s energy density is made up of the    matter    described by the standard model of particle physics   and the majority of the universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy   with little agreement amongst scientists about what these are made of
which model suggests that matter is 5   of the universe	lambda cdm model	7	9
2489 with the advent of quantum physics   some scientists believed the concept of matter had merely changed   while others believed the conventional position could no longer be maintained   for instance werner heisenberg said    the ontology of materialism rested upon the illusion that the kind of existence   the direct  actuality   of the world around us   can be extrapolated into the atomic range   this extrapolation   however   is impossible     atoms are not things      likewise   some philosophers   which     feel that these dichotomies necessitate a switch from materialism to physicalism   others use the terms    materialism    and    physicalism    interchangeably
werner heisenberg suggested that atoms are not what	things	68	68
2490 some modern day physicists and science writers such as paul davies and john gribbin have argued that materialism has been disproven by certain scientific findings in physics   such as quantum mechanics and chaos theory   in 1991   gribbin and davies released their book the matter myth   the first chapter of which      the death of materialism      contained the following passage
what are some of the findings that support their argument	quantum mechanics and chaos theory	29	33
2491 davies   and gribbin  s objections are shared by proponents of digital physics who view information rather than matter to be fundamental   their objections were also shared by some founders of quantum theory   such as max planck   who wrote
digital physicists consider what to be more important than matter	information	14	14
2492 according to the catholic encyclopedia of 1907 1912   materialism   defined as    a philosophical system which regards matter as the only reality in the world         denies the existence of god and the soul      materialism   in this view   therefore becomes incompatible with most world religions   including christianity   judaism   and islam   in such a context one can conflate materialism with atheism   most of hinduism and transcendentalism regards all matter as an illusion called maya   blinding humans from knowing    the truth      maya is the limited   purely physical and mental reality in which our everyday consciousness has become entangled   maya gets destroyed for a person when s he perceives brahman with transcendental knowledge
based on the above definition   materialism is not consistent with what	religions	42	42
2493 in contrast   joseph smith   the founder of the latter day saint movement   taught      there is no such thing as immaterial matter   all spirit is matter   but it is more fine or pure   and can only be discerned by purer eyes   we can not see it   but when our bodies are purified we shall see that it is all matter      this spirit element has always existed   it is co eternal with god   it is also called    intelligence    or    the light of truth      which like all observable matter    was not created or made   neither indeed can be      members of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints view the revelations of joseph smith as a restoration of original christian doctrine   which they believe post apostolic theologians began to corrupt in the centuries after christ   the writings of many   quantify   of these theologians indicate a clear influence of greek metaphysical philosophies such as neoplatonism   which characterized divinity as an utterly simple   immaterial   formless   substance essence   ousia   that transcended all that was physical   despite strong opposition from many christians   this metaphysical depiction of god eventually became incorporated into the doctrine of the christian church   displacing the original judeo christian concept of a physical   corporeal god who created humans in his image and likeness

2494 an argument for idealism   such as those of hegel and berkeley   is ipso facto an argument against materialism   matter can be argued to be redundant   as in bundle theory   and mind independent properties can in turn be reduced to subjective percepts   berkeley presents an example of the latter by pointing out that it is impossible to gather direct evidence of matter   as there is no direct experience of matter   all that is experienced is perception   whether internal or external   as such   the existence of matter can only be assumed from the apparent   perceived   stability of perceptions   it finds absolutely no evidence in direct experience

2496 some critics object to materialism as part of an overly skeptical   narrow or reductivist approach to theorizing   rather than to the ontological claim that matter is the only substance   particle physicist and anglican theologian john polkinghorne objects to what he calls promissory materialism   claims that materialistic science will eventually succeed in explaining phenomena it has not so far been able to explain   polkinghorne prefers    dual aspect monism    to faith in materialism

2497 the space race was a 20th century competition between two cold war rivals   the soviet union   ussr   and the united states   us     for supremacy in spaceflight capability   it had its origins in the missile based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following world war ii   enabled by captured german rocket technology and personnel   the technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security   and symbolic of ideological superiority   the space race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites   unmanned space probes of the moon   venus   and mars   and human spaceflight in low earth orbit and to the moon   the competition began on august 2   1955   when the soviet union responded to the us announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the international geophysical year   by declaring they would also launch a satellite    in the near future      the soviet union beat the us to this   with the october 4   1957 orbiting of sputnik 1   and later beat the us to the first human in space   yuri gagarin   on april 12   1961  the space race peaked with the july 20   1969 us landing of the first humans on the moon with apollo 11  the ussr tried but failed manned lunar missions   and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on earth orbital space stations   a period of d tente followed with the april 1972 agreement on a co operative apollo soyuz test project   resulting in the july 1975 rendezvous in earth orbit of a us astronaut crew with a soviet cosmonaut crew
whose technology enabled the space race between the soviet union and the united states	german rocket technology	51	53
2498 the space race can trace its origins to germany   beginning in the 1930s and continuing during world war ii when nazi germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles   starting in the early 1930s   during the last stages of the weimar republic   german aerospace engineers experimented with liquid fueled rockets   with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances   the head of the german army  s ballistics and munitions branch   lieutenant colonel karl emil becker   gathered a small team of engineers that included walter dornberger and leo zanssen   to figure out how to use rockets as long range artillery in order to get around the treaty of versailles   ban on research and development of long range cannons   wernher von braun   a young engineering prodigy   was recruited by becker and dornberger to join their secret army program at kummersdorf west in 1932  von braun had dreams about conquering outer space with rockets   and did not initially see the military value in missile technology

2499 during the second world war   general dornberger was the military head of the army  s rocket program   zanssen became the commandant of the peenem nde army rocket centre   and von braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program   they would lead the team that built the aggregate 4   a 4   rocket   which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943  by 1943   germany began mass producing the a 4 as the vergeltungswaffe 2      vengeance weapon    2   or more commonly   v2     a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers   200 mi   range carrying a 1 130 kilograms   2 490 lb   warhead at 4 000 kilometers per hour   2 500 mph     its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it   and radar detection provided little warning   germany used the weapon to bombard southern england and parts of allied liberated western europe from 1944 until 1945  after the war   the v 2 became the basis of early american and soviet rocket designs

2500 at war  s end   american   british   and soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture germany  s rocket engineers along with the german rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based   each of the allies captured a share of the available members of the german rocket team   but the united states benefited the most with operation paperclip   recruiting von braun and most of his engineering team   who later helped develop the american missile and space exploration programs   the united states also acquired a large number of complete v2 rockets

2501 the german rocket center in peenem nde was located in the eastern part of germany   which became the soviet zone of occupation   on stalin  s orders   the soviet union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems   the soviet rocket engineers were led by sergei korolev   he had been involved in space clubs and early soviet rocket design in the 1930s   but was arrested in 1938 during joseph stalin  s great purge and imprisoned for six years in siberia   after the war   he became the ussr  s chief rocket and spacecraft engineer   essentially the soviet counterpart to von braun   his identity was kept a state secret throughout the cold war   and he was identified publicly only as    the chief designer      in the west   his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966

2502 after almost a year in the area around peenem nde   soviet officials moved most of the captured german rocket specialists to gorodomlya island on lake seliger   about 240 kilometers   150 mi   northwest of moscow   they were not allowed to participate in soviet missile design   but were used as problem solving consultants to the soviet engineers   they helped in the following areas   the creation of a soviet version of the a 4   work on    organizational schemes      research in improving the a 4 main engine   development of a 100 ton engine   assistance in the    layout    of plant production rooms   and preparation of rocket assembly using german components   with their help   particularly helmut groettrup  s group   korolev reverse engineered the a 4 and built his own version of the rocket   the r 1   in 1948  later   he developed his own distinct designs   though many of these designs were influenced by the groettrup group  s g4 r10 design from 1949  the germans were eventually repatriated in 1951 53

2503 the american professor robert h  goddard had worked on developing solid fuel rockets since 1914   and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the us army signal corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended world war i  he also started developing liquid fueled rockets in 1921   yet he had not been taken seriously by the public   and was not sponsored by the government as part of the post ww ii rocket development effort   von braun   himself inspired by goddard  s work   was bemused by this when debriefed by his american handlers   asking them      why did n t you just ask dr   goddard        citation needed

2504 von braun and his team were sent to the united states army  s white sands proving ground   located in new mexico   in 1945  they set about assembling the captured v2s and began a program of launching them and instructing american engineers in their operation   these tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space   and the first two stage rocket   the wac corporal v2 combination   in 1949  the german rocket team was moved from fort bliss to the army  s new redstone arsenal   located in huntsville   alabama   in 1950  from here   von braun and his team would develop the army  s first operational medium range ballistic missile   the redstone rocket   that would   in slightly modified versions   launch both america  s first satellite   and the first piloted mercury space missions   it became the basis for both the jupiter and saturn family of rockets

2505 in simple terms   the cold war could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism   the united states faced a new uncertainty beginning in september 1949   when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb   american intelligence agencies discovered that the soviet union had exploded its first atomic bomb   with the consequence that the united states potentially could face a future nuclear war that   for the first time   might devastate its cities   given this new danger   the united states participated in an arms race with the soviet union that included development of the hydrogen bomb   as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles   icbms   capable of delivering nuclear weapons   a new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the united states during the 1950s   which devolved into paranoid mccarthyism   with communism spreading in china   korea   and eastern europe   americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive    witch hunts    to expose communist spies   part of the american reaction to the soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large air force   under the control of the strategic air command   sac     sac employed intercontinental strategic bombers   as well as medium bombers based close to soviet airspace   in western europe and in turkey   that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads
what year did the us lose its monopoly to the atomic bomb	1949	30	30
2506 for its part   the soviet union harbored fears of invasion   having suffered at least 27 million casualties during world war ii after being invaded by nazi germany in 1941   the soviet union was wary of its former ally   the united states   which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons   the united states had used these weapons operationally during world war ii   and it could use them again against the soviet union   laying waste its cities and military centers   since the americans had a much larger air force than the soviet union   and the united states maintained advance air bases near soviet territory   in 1947 stalin ordered the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles   icbms   in order to counter the perceived american threat
how many casualties did the soviet union have during wwii	27 million	14	15
2507 in 1953   korolev was given the go ahead to develop the r 7 semyorka rocket   which represented a major advance from the german design   although some of its components   notably boosters   still resembled the german g 4   the new rocket incorporated staged design   a completely new control system   and a new fuel   it was successfully tested on august 21   1957 and became the world  s first fully operational icbm the following month   it would later be used to launch the first satellite into space   and derivatives would launch all piloted soviet spacecraft
who began developing the r 7 semyorka rocket	korolev	2	2
2508 the united states had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the american armed services   which meant that each force developed its own icbm program   the air force initiated icbm research in 1945 with the mx 774   however   its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in 1947  in 1950   von braun began testing the air force pgm 11 redstone rocket family at cape canaveral   in 1951   the air force began a new icbm program called mx 1593   and by 1955 this program was receiving top priority funding   the mx 1593 program evolved to become the atlas a   with its maiden launch occurring june 11   1957   becoming the first successful american icbm   its upgraded version   the atlas d rocket   would later serve as an operational nuclear icbm and as the orbital launch vehicle for project mercury and the remote controlled agena target vehicle used in project gemini

2509 in 1955   with both the united states and the soviet union building ballistic missiles that could be utilized to launch objects into space   the    starting line    was drawn for the space race   in separate announcements   just four days apart   both nations publicly announced that they would launch artificial earth satellites by 1957 or 1958  on july 29   1955   james c  hagerty   president dwight d  eisenhower  s press secretary   announced that the united states intended to launch    small earth circling satellites    between july 1   1957   and december 31   1958   as part of their contribution to the international geophysical year   igy     four days later   at the sixth congress of international astronautical federation in copenhagen   scientist leonid i  sedov spoke to international reporters at the soviet embassy   and announced his country  s intention to launch a satellite as well   in the    near future      on august 30   1955   korolev managed to get the soviet academy of sciences to create a commission whose purpose was to beat the americans into earth orbit   this was the de facto start date for the space race   the council of ministers of the soviet union began a policy of treating development of its space program as a classified state secret
who was president dwight d  eisenhower  s press secretary	james c  hagerty	58	60
2510 initially   president eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometers   62 mi     might be construed as violating that nation  s sovereign airspace   he was concerned that the soviet union would accuse the americans of an illegal overflight   thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense   eisenhower and his advisors believed that a nation  s airspace sovereignty did not extend into outer space   acknowledged as the k rm n line   and he used the 1957 58 international geophysical year launches to establish this principle in international law   eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a    warmonger    if he were to use military missiles as launchers   therefore   he selected the untried naval research laboratory  s vanguard rocket   which was a research only booster   this meant that von braun  s team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their jupiter c rocket   because of its intended use as a future military vehicle   on september 20   1956   von braun and his team did launch a jupiter c that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit   but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology
a jupiter c was launched by von braum on what date	september 20   1956	165	167
2511 the soviet success caused public controversy in the united states   and eisenhower ordered the civilian rocket and satellite project   vanguard   to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned   the december 6   1957 project vanguard launch failure occurred at cape canaveral air force station in florida   broadcast live in front of a us television audience   it was a monumental failure   exploding a few seconds after launch   and it became an international joke   the satellite appeared in newspapers under the names flopnik   stayputnik   kaputnik   and dudnik   in the united nations   the russian delegate offered the u s  representative aid    under the soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations      only in the wake of this very public failure did von braun  s redstone team get the go ahead to launch their jupiter c rocket as soon as they could   in britain   the usa  s western cold war ally   the reaction was mixed   some members of the population celebrated the fact that the soviets had reached space first   while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring

2512 on january 31   1958   nearly four months after the launch of sputnik 1   von braun and the united states successfully launched its first satellite on a four stage juno i rocket derived from the us army  s redstone missile   at cape canaveral   the satellite explorer 1 was 30 8 pounds   14 0 kg   in mass   it carried a micrometeorite gauge and a geiger m ller tube   it passed in and out of the earth encompassing radiation belt with its 194 by 1 368 nautical mile   360 by 2 534 km   orbit   therefore saturating the tube  s capacity and proving what dr  james van allen   a space scientist at the university of iowa   had theorized   the belt   named the van allen radiation belt   is a doughnut shaped zone of high level radiation intensity around the earth above the magnetic equator   van allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of explorer 1  the satellite actually measured three phenomena   cosmic ray and radiation levels   the temperature in the spacecraft   and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites   the satellite had no memory for data storage   therefore it had to transmit continuously   two months later in march 1958   a second satellite was sent into orbit with augmented cosmic ray instruments

2513 on april 2   1958   president eisenhower reacted to the soviet space lead in launching the first satellite   by recommending to the us congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities   congress   led by senate majority leader lyndon b  johnson   responded by passing the national aeronautics and space act   which eisenhower signed into law on july 29   1958  this law turned the national advisory committee on aeronautics into the national aeronautics and space administration   nasa     it also created a civilian military liaison committee   chaired by the president   responsible for coordinating the nation  s civilian and military space programs

2514 on october 21   1959   eisenhower approved the transfer of the army  s remaining space related activities to nasa   on july 1   1960   the redstone arsenal became nasa  s george c  marshall space flight center   with von braun as its first director   development of the saturn rocket family   which when mature   would finally give the us parity with the soviets in terms of lifting capability   was thus transferred to nasa

2515 the us reacted to the luna program by embarking on the ranger program in 1959   managed by nasa  s jet propulsion laboratory   the block i ranger 1 and ranger 2 suffered atlas agena launch failures in august and november 1961  the 727 pound   330 kg   block ii ranger 3 launched successfully on january 26   1962   but missed the moon   the 730 pound   330 kg   ranger 4 became the first us spacecraft to reach the moon   but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data   ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the moon by 725 kilometers   391 nmi   on october 21   1962  the first successful ranger mission was the 806 pound   366 kg   block iii ranger 7 which impacted on july 31   1964

2516 by 1959   american observers believed that the soviet union would be the first to get a human into space   because of the time needed to prepare for mercury  s first launch   on april 12   1961   the ussr surprised the world again by launching yuri gagarin into a single orbit around the earth in a craft they called vostok 1  they dubbed gagarin the first cosmonaut   roughly translated from russian and greek as    sailor of the universe      although he had the ability to take over manual control of his spacecraft in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer   it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution   medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space   vostok 1 orbited the earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the soviet union   with gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7 000 meters   23 000 ft     and landing by parachute   the f d ration a ronautique internationale   international federation of aeronautics   credited gagarin with the world  s first human space flight   although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft   for this reason   the soviet union omitted from their fai submission the fact that gagarin did not land with his capsule   when the fai filing for gherman titov  s second vostok flight in august 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique   the fai committee decided to investigate   and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch   orbiting   and return   rather than the manner of landing   and so revised their rules accordingly   keeping gagarin  s and titov  s records intact

2520 gagarin  s flight changed this   now kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the american public over the soviet lead   he sent a memo dated april 20   1961   to vice president lyndon b  johnson   asking him to look into the state of america  s space program   and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up   the two major options at the time seemed to be   either establishment of an earth orbital space station   or a manned landing on the moon   johnson in turn consulted with von braun   who answered kennedy  s questions based on his estimates of us and soviet rocket lifting capability   based on this   johnson responded to kennedy   concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership   and recommending that the manned moon landing was far enough in the future that the us had a fighting chance to achieve it first

2527 the soviets kept the details and true appearance of the vostok capsule secret until the april 1965 moscow economic exhibition   where it was first displayed without its aerodynamic nose cone concealing the spherical capsule   the    vostok spaceship    had been first displayed at the july 1961 tushino air show   mounted on its launch vehicle  s third stage   with the nose cone in place   a tail section with eight fins was also added   in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers   this spurious tail section also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary

2529 on october 2   1997   it was reported that khrushchev  s son sergei claimed khrushchev was poised to accept kennedy  s proposal at the time of kennedy  s assassination on november 22   1963  during the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture   and decided to accept kennedy  s offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world  s two superpowers   but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he did not have the same trust for kennedy  s successor   lyndon johnson
president kennedy was killed when	november 22   1963	29	31
2530 as president   johnson steadfastly pursued the gemini and apollo programs   promoting them as kennedy  s legacy to the american public   one week after kennedy  s death   he issued an executive order renaming the cape canaveral and apollo launch facilities after kennedy

2531 focused by the commitment to a moon landing   in january 1962 the us announced project gemini   a two man spacecraft that would support the later three man apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft   flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the moon and back   and extra vehicular activity to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft
what year was the gemini project confirmed	1962	10	10
2532 the greater advances of the soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts   including the first eva    spacewalk    and the first mission performed by a crew in shirt sleeves   gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight   allowing the soviets to achieve another first   launching voskhod 1 on october 12   1964   the first spacecraft with a three cosmonaut crew   the ussr touted another technological achievement during this mission   it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt sleeve environment   however   flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the soviet spacecraft  s environmental systems   rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft  s limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits   flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization   this feat would not be repeated until the us apollo command module flew in 1968   this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt sleeve environment while in space

2538 the us and ussr began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958   presenting issues for debate to the united nations   which created a committee on the peaceful uses of outer space in 1959
the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space was established in what year	1959	36	36
2539 on may 10   1962   vice president johnson addressed the second national conference on the peaceful uses of space revealing that the united states and the ussr both supported a resolution passed by the political committee of the un general assembly on december 1962   which not only urged member nations to    extend the rules of international law to outer space      but to also cooperate in its exploration   following the passing of this resolution   kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative american soviet space program

2541 in 1967   both nations faced serious challenges that brought their programs to temporary halts   both had been rushing at full speed toward the first piloted flights of apollo and soyuz   without paying due diligence to growing design and manufacturing problems   the results proved fatal to both pioneering crews
both crews were killed on which spacecraft missions in 1967	apollo and soyuz	27	29
2542 on january 27   1967   the same day the us and ussr signed the outer space treaty   the crew of the first manned apollo mission   command pilot virgil    gus    grissom   senior pilot edward h  white   and pilot roger chaffee   were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test   less than a month before the planned february 21 launch   an investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark   and quickly grew out of control   fed by the spacecraft  s pure oxygen atmosphere   crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the plug door hatch cover against the greater than atmospheric internal pressure   the board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft   and procedural failings   including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pure oxygen atmosphere   as well as inadequate safety procedures   all these flaws had to be corrected over the next twenty two months until the first piloted flight could be made   mercury and gemini veteran grissom had been a favored choice of deke slayton   nasa  s director of flight crew operations   to make the first piloted landing
the outer space treaty was signed by the us and the ussr on what date	january 27   1967	1	3
2543 meanwhile   the soviet union was having its own problems with soyuz development   engineers reported 200 design faults to party leaders   but their concerns    were overruled by political pressures for a series of space feats to mark the anniversary of lenin  s birthday        citation needed   on april 24   1967   the single pilot of soyuz 1   vladimir komarov   became the first in flight spaceflight fatality   the mission was planned to be a three day test   to include the first soviet docking with an unpiloted soyuz 2   but the mission was plagued with problems   early on   komarov  s craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed   then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely   resulting in the craft spinning wildly   komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system   which was only partially effective   the flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day   during the emergency re entry   a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail   and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute   komarov was killed on impact   fixing the spacecraft faults caused an eighteen month delay before piloted soyuz flights could resume
who was the person credited with the first in flight space death	vladimir komarov	54	55
2544 the united states recovered from the apollo 1 fire   fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the block ii command module   the us proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the saturn v launch vehicle   apollo 4 and apollo 6   and the lunar module   apollo 5   during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968  apollo 1  s mission to check out the apollo command service module in earth orbit was accomplished by grissom  s backup crew commanded by walter schirra on apollo 7   launched on october 11   1968  the eleven day mission was a total success   as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission   paving the way for the united states to continue with its lunar mission schedule
apollo 7 launched from earth on what date	october 11   1968	87	89
2545 the soviet union also fixed the parachute and control problems with soyuz   and the next piloted mission soyuz 3 was launched on october 26   1968  the goal was to complete komarov  s rendezvous and docking mission with the un piloted soyuz 2  ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters   660 ft   of each other   then cosmonaut georgy beregovoy took control   he got within 40 meters   130 ft   of his target   but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel   due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft   the first docking of soviet spacecraft was finally realised in january 1969 by the soyuz 4 and soyuz 5 missions   it was the first ever docking of two manned spacecraft   and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another
the soyuz 3 began its mission to space on what date	october 26   1968	22	24
2546 the soviet zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968   after five unsuccessful and partially successful automated test launches   cosmos 146 on march 10   1967   cosmos 154 on april 8   1967   zond 1967a september 27   1967   zond 1967b on november 22   1967  zond 4 was launched on march 2   1968   and successfully made a circumlunar flight   after its successful flight around the moon   zond 4 encountered problems with its earth reentry on march 9   and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge 15 000 meters   49 000 ft   over the gulf of guinea   the soviet official announcement said that zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction   due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the atlantic ocean instead of over the ussr

2547 during the summer of 1968   the apollo program hit another snag   the first pilot rated lunar module   lm   was not ready for orbital tests in time for a december 1968 launch   nasa planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order   delaying the first lm flight until march 1969   and sending apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the lm in december   this mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the soviet union might be ready for a piloted zond flight during late 1968  in september 1968   zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned to earth   accomplishing the first successful water landing of the soviet space program in the indian ocean   it also scared nasa planners   as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight   not piloted   because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the moon   on november 10   1968 another automated test flight   zond 6 was launched   but this time encountered difficulties in its earth reentry   and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early   causing it to crash land only 16 kilometers   9 9 mi   from where it had been launched six days earlier   it turned out there was no chance of a piloted soviet circumlunar flight during 1968   due to the unreliability of the zonds
the first successful water landing in the indian ocean by the soviets was was when	1968	4	4
2548 on december 21   1968   frank borman   james lovell   and william anders became the first humans to ride the saturn v rocket into space on apollo 8  they also became the first to leave low earth orbit and go to another celestial body   and entered lunar orbit on december 24  they made ten orbits in twenty hours   and transmitted one of the most watched tv broadcasts in history   with their christmas eve program from lunar orbit   that concluded with a reading from the biblical book of genesis   two and a half hours after the broadcast   they fired their engine to perform the first trans earth injection to leave lunar orbit and return to the earth   apollo 8 safely landed in the pacific ocean on december 27   in nasa  s first dawn splashdown and recovery

2557 having lost the race to the moon   the ussr decided to concentrate on orbital space stations   during 1969 and 1970   they launched six more soyuz flights after soyuz 3   then launched the first space station   the salyut 1 laboratory designed by kerim kerimov   on april 19   1971  three days later   the soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it   but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station   the soyuz 11 crew of vladislav volkov   georgi dobrovolski and viktor patsayev successfully docked on june 7   and completed a record 22 day stay   the crew became the second in flight space fatality during their reentry on june 30  they were asphyxiated when their spacecraft  s cabin lost all pressure   shortly after undocking   the disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve   that allowed all the air to vent into space   the crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred
the ussr launched their first space station on what date	april 19   1971	44	46
2558 salyut 1  s orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry   but further piloted flights were delayed while the soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem   the station re entered the earth  s atmosphere on october 11   after 175 days in orbit   the ussr attempted to launch a second salyut class station designated durable orbital station 2   dos 2   on july 29   1972   but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit   after the dos 2 failure   the ussr attempted to launch four more salyut class stations through 1975   with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage   which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it would n t hold pressure   while all of the salyuts were presented to the public as non military scientific laboratories   some of them were actually covers for the military almaz reconnaissance stations

2568 historically   pubs have been socially and culturally distinct from caf s   bars and german beer halls   most pubs offer a range of beers   wines   spirits   and soft drinks and snacks   traditionally the windows of town pubs were of smoked or frosted glass to obscure the clientele from the street but from the 1990s onwards   there has been a move towards clear glass   in keeping with brighter interiors

2570 until the 1970s most of the larger pubs also featured an off sales counter or attached shop for the sales of beers   wines and spirits for home consumption   in the 1970s the newly built supermarkets and high street chain stores or off licences undercut the pub prices to such a degree that within ten years all but a handful of pubs had closed their off sale counters   which had often been referred to colloquially as the jug and bottle

2571 the inhabitants of the british isles have been drinking ale since the bronze age   but it was with the arrival of the roman empire in its shores in the 1st century   and the construction of the roman road networks that the first inns   called tabernae   in which travellers could obtain refreshment began to appear   after the departure of roman authority in the 5th century and the fall of the romano british kingdoms   the anglo saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings   the anglo saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready   these alehouses quickly evolved into meeting houses for the folk to socially congregate   gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities   herein lies the origin of the modern public house   or    pub    as it is colloquially called in england   they rapidly spread across the kingdom   becoming so commonplace that in 965 king edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village

2572 a traveller in the early middle ages could obtain overnight accommodation in monasteries   but later a demand for hostelries grew with the popularity of pilgrimages and travel   the hostellers of london were granted guild status in 1446 and in 1514 the guild became the worshipful company of innholders

2573 inns are buildings where travellers can seek lodging and   usually   food and drink   they are typically located in the country or along a highway   in europe   they possibly first sprang up when the romans built a system of roads two millennia ago     citation needed   some inns in europe are several centuries old   in addition to providing for the needs of travellers   inns traditionally acted as community gathering places

2574 in europe   it is the provision of accommodation   if anything   that now distinguishes inns from taverns   alehouses and pubs   the latter tend to provide alcohol   and   in the uk   soft drinks and often food     but less commonly accommodation   inns tend to be older and grander establishments   historically they provided not only food and lodging   but also stabling and fodder for the traveller  s horse   s   and on some roads fresh horses for the mail coach   famous london inns include the george   southwark and the tabard   there is however no longer a formal distinction between an inn and other kinds of establishment   many pubs use    inn    in their name   either because they are long established former coaching inns   or to summon up a particular kind of image   or in many cases simply as a pun on the word    in      as in    the welcome inn      the name of many pubs in scotland

2577 traditional english ale was made solely from fermented malt   the practice of adding hops to produce beer was introduced from the netherlands in the early 15th century   alehouses would each brew their own distinctive ale   but independent breweries began to appear in the late 17th century   by the end of the century almost all beer was brewed by commercial breweries

2578 the 18th century saw a huge growth in the number of drinking establishments   primarily due to the introduction of gin   gin was brought to england by the dutch after the glorious revolution of 1688 and became very popular after the government created a market for    cuckoo grain    or    cuckoo malt    that was unfit to be used in brewing and distilling by allowing unlicensed gin and beer production   while imposing a heavy duty on all imported spirits   as thousands of gin shops sprang up all over england   brewers fought back by increasing the number of alehouses   by 1740 the production of gin had increased to six times that of beer and because of its cheapness it became popular with the poor   leading to the so called gin craze   over half of the 15 000 drinking establishments in london were gin shops

2579 the drunkenness and lawlessness created by gin was seen to lead to ruination and degradation of the working classes   the distinction   clarification needed   was illustrated by william hogarth in his engravings beer street and gin lane   the gin act 1736 imposed high taxes on retailers and led to riots in the streets   the prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742  the gin act 1751 however was more successful   it forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates

2580 by the early 19th century   encouraged by lower duties on gin   the gin houses or    gin palaces    had spread from london to most cities and towns in britain   with most of the new establishments illegal and unlicensed   these bawdy   loud and unruly drinking dens so often described by charles dickens in his sketches by boz   published 1835 1836   increasingly came to be held as unbridled cesspits of immorality or crime and the source of much ill health and alcoholism among the working classes

2581 under a banner of    reducing public drunkenness    the beer act of 1830 introduced a new lower tier of premises permitted to sell alcohol   the beer houses   at the time beer was viewed as harmless   nutritious and even healthy   young children were often given what was described as small beer   which was brewed to have a low alcohol content   as the local water was often unsafe   even the evangelical church and temperance movements of the day viewed the drinking of beer very much as a secondary evil and a normal accompaniment to a meal   the freely available beer was thus intended to wean the drinkers off the evils of gin   or so the thinking went

2582 under the 1830 act any householder who paid rates could apply   with a one off payment of two guineas   roughly equal in value to  168 today     to sell beer or cider in his home   usually the front parlour   and even to brew his own on his premises   the permission did not extend to the sale of spirits and fortified wines   and any beer house discovered selling those items was closed down and the owner heavily fined   beer houses were not permitted to open on sundays   the beer was usually served in jugs or dispensed directly from tapped wooden barrels on a table in the corner of the room   often profits were so high the owners were able to buy the house next door to live in   turning every room in their former home into bars and lounges for customers

2583 in the first year   400 beer houses opened and within eight years there were 46 000 across the country   far outnumbering the combined total of long established taverns   pubs   inns and hotels   because it was so easy to obtain permission and the profits could be huge compared to the low cost of gaining permission   the number of beer houses was continuing to rise and in some towns nearly every other house in a street could be a beer house   finally in 1869 the growth had to be checked by magisterial control and new licensing laws were introduced   only then was it made harder to get a licence   and the licensing laws which operate today were formulated
how many beer houses opened their doors in the inaugural year of the beer act	400	4	4
2584 although the new licensing laws prevented new beer houses from being created   those already in existence were allowed to continue and many did not close until nearly the end of the 19th century   a very small number remained into the 21st century   the vast majority of the beer houses applied for the new licences and became full pubs   these usually small establishments can still be identified in many towns   seemingly oddly located in the middle of otherwise terraced housing part way up a street   unlike purpose built pubs that are usually found on corners or road junctions   many of today  s respected real ale micro brewers in the uk started as home based beer house brewers under the 1830 act

2585 the beer houses tended to avoid the traditional pub names like the crown   the red lion   the royal oak etc   and   if they did not simply name their place smith  s beer house   they would apply topical pub names in an effort to reflect the mood of the times

2586 there was already regulation on public drinking spaces in the 17th and 18th centuries     citation needed   and the income earned from licences was beneficial to the crown   tavern owners were required to possess a licence to sell ale   and a separate licence for distilled spirits

2587 from the mid 19th century on the opening hours of licensed premises in the uk were restricted   however licensing was gradually liberalised after the 1960s   until contested licensing applications became very rare   and the remaining administrative function was transferred to local authorities in 2005

2588 the wine and beerhouse act 1869 reintroduced the stricter controls of the previous century   the sale of beers   wines or spirits required a licence for the premises from the local magistrates   further provisions regulated gaming   drunkenness   prostitution and undesirable conduct on licensed premises   enforceable by prosecution or more effectively by the landlord under threat of forfeiting his licence   licences were only granted   transferred or renewed at special licensing sessions courts   and were limited to respectable individuals   often these were ex servicemen or ex policemen   retiring to run a pub was popular amongst military officers at the end of their service   licence conditions varied widely   according to local practice   they would specify permitted hours   which might require sunday closing   or conversely permit all night opening near a market   typically they might require opening throughout the permitted hours   and the provision of food or lavatories   once obtained   licences were jealously protected by the licensees   who were expected to be generally present   not an absentee owner or company     and even    occasional licences    to serve drinks at temporary premises such as f tes would usually be granted only to existing licensees   objections might be made by the police   rival landlords or anyone else on the grounds of infractions such as serving drunks   disorderly or dirty premises   or ignoring permitted hours

2590 the restrictions were tightened by the defence of the realm act of august 1914   which   along with the introduction of rationing and the censorship of the press for wartime purposes   restricted pubs   opening hours to 12 noon 2 30 pm and 6 30 pm 9 30 pm   opening for the full licensed hours was compulsory   and closing time was equally firmly enforced by the police   a landlord might lose his licence for infractions   pubs were closed under the act and compensation paid   for example in pembrokeshire

2591 there was a special case established under the state management scheme where the brewery and licensed premises were bought and run by the state until 1973   most notably in carlisle   during the 20th century elsewhere   both the licensing laws and enforcement were progressively relaxed   and there were differences between parishes   in the 1960s   at closing time in kensington at 10 30 pm   drinkers would rush over the parish boundary to be in good time for    last orders    in knightsbridge before 11 pm   a practice observed in many pubs adjoining licensing area boundaries   some scottish and welsh parishes remained officially    dry    on sundays   although often this merely required knocking at the back door of the pub     these restricted opening hours led to the tradition of lock ins

2592 however   closing times were increasingly disregarded in the country pubs   in england and wales by 2000 pubs could legally open from 11 am   12 noon on sundays   through to 11 pm   10 30 pm on sundays     that year was also the first to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11 am on new year  s eve to 11 pm on new year  s day   in addition   many cities had by laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1 am   whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning   pubs near london  s smithfield market   billingsgate fish market and covent garden fruit and flower market could stay open 24 hours a day since victorian times to provide a service to the shift working employees of the markets

2593 scotland  s and northern ireland  s licensing laws have long been more flexible   allowing local authorities to set pub opening and closing times   in scotland   this stemmed out of   clarification needed   a late repeal of the wartime licensing laws   which stayed in force until 1976

2594 the licensing act 2003   which came into force on 24 november 2005   consolidated the many laws into a single act   this allowed pubs in england and wales to apply to the local council for the opening hours of their choice   it was argued that this would end the concentration of violence around 11 30 pm   when people had to leave the pub   making policing easier   in practice   alcohol related hospital admissions rose following the change in the law   with alcohol involved in 207 800 admissions in 2006 7   critics claimed that these laws would lead to    24 hour drinking      by the time the law came into effect   60 326 establishments had applied for longer hours and 1 121 had applied for a licence to sell alcohol 24 hours a day   however nine months later many pubs had not changed their hours   although some stayed open longer at the weekend   but rarely beyond 1 00 am

2595 a    lock in    is when a pub owner lets drinkers stay in the pub after the legal closing time   on the theory that once the doors are locked   it becomes a private party rather than a pub   patrons may put money behind the bar before official closing time   and redeem their drinks during the lock in so no drinks are technically sold after closing time   the origin of the british lock in was a reaction to 1915 changes in the licensing laws in england and wales   which curtailed opening hours to stop factory workers from turning up drunk and harming the war effort   since 1915   the uk licensing laws had changed very little   with comparatively early closing times   the tradition of the lock in therefore remained   since the implementation of licensing act 2003   premises in england and wales may apply to extend their opening hours beyond 11 pm   allowing round the clock drinking and removing much of the need for lock ins   since the smoking ban   some establishments operated a lock in during which the remaining patrons could smoke without repercussions but   unlike drinking lock ins   allowing smoking in a pub was still a prosecutable offence

2596 in march 2006   a law was introduced to forbid smoking in all enclosed public places in scotland   wales followed suit in april 2007   with england introducing the ban in july 2007  pub landlords had raised concerns prior to the implementation of the law that a smoking ban would have a negative impact on sales   after two years   the impact of the ban was mixed   some pubs suffered declining sales   while others developed their food sales   the wetherspoon pub chain reported in june 2009 that profits were at the top end of expectations   however   scottish   newcastle  s takeover by carlsberg and heineken was reported in january 2008 as partly the result of its weakness following falling sales due to the ban   similar bans are applied in australian pubs with smoking only allowed in designated areas

2611 a trend in the late 20th century was for breweries to run their pubs directly   using managers rather than tenants   most such breweries   such as the regional brewery shepherd neame in kent and young  s and fuller  s in london   control hundreds of pubs in a particular region of the uk   while a few   such as greene king   are spread nationally   the landlord of a tied pub may be an employee of the brewery in which case he she would be a manager of a managed house   or a self employed tenant who has entered into a lease agreement with a brewery   a condition of which is the legal obligation   trade tie   only to purchase that brewery  s beer   the beer selection is mainly limited to beers brewed by that particular company   the beer orders   passed in 1989   were aimed at getting tied houses to offer at least one alternative beer   known as a guest beer   from another brewery   this law has now been repealed but while in force it dramatically altered the industry   some pubs still offer a regularly changing selection of guest beers

2797 in the 1950s   lewis binford suggested that early humans were obtaining meat via scavenging   not hunting   early humans in the lower paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands   which allowed them to collect seafood   eggs   nuts   and fruits besides scavenging   rather than killing large animals for meat   according to this view   they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes   archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of paleolithic hunter gatherers survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover

2798 according to the endurance running hypothesis   long distance running as in persistence hunting   a method still practiced by some hunter gatherer groups in modern times   was likely the driving evolutionary force leading to the evolution of certain human characteristics   this hypothesis does not necessarily contradict the scavenging hypothesis   both subsistence strategies could have been in use   sequentially   alternating or even simultaneously

2799 hunting and gathering was presumably the subsistence strategy employed by human societies beginning some 1 8 million years ago   by homo erectus   and from its appearance some 0 2 million years ago by homo sapiens   it remained the only mode of subsistence until the end of the mesolithic period some 10 000 years ago   and after this was replaced only gradually with the spread of the neolithic revolution

2800 starting at the transition between the middle to upper paleolithic period   some 80 000 to 70 000 years ago   some hunter gatherers bands began to specialize   concentrating on hunting a smaller selection of   often larger   game and gathering a smaller selection of food   this specialization of work also involved creating specialized tools   like fishing nets and hooks and bone harpoons   the transition into the subsequent neolithic period is chiefly defined by the unprecedented development of nascent agricultural practices   agriculture originated and spread in several different areas including the middle east   asia   mesoamerica   and the andes beginning as early as 12 000 years ago

2802 many groups continued their hunter gatherer ways of life   although their numbers have continually declined   partly as a result of pressure from growing agricultural and pastoral communities   many of them reside in the developing world   either in arid regions or tropical forests   areas that were formerly available to hunter gatherers were and continue to be encroached upon by the settlements of agriculturalists   in the resulting competition for land use   hunter gatherer societies either adopted these practices or moved to other areas   in addition   jared diamond has blamed a decline in the availability of wild foods   particularly animal resources   in north and south america   for example   most large mammal species had gone extinct by the end of the pleistocene according to diamond   because of overexploitation by humans   although the overkill hypothesis he advocates is strongly contested     by whom

2803 as the number and size of agricultural societies increased   they expanded into lands traditionally used by hunter gatherers   this process of agriculture driven expansion led to the development of the first forms of government in agricultural centers   such as the fertile crescent   ancient india   ancient china   olmec   sub saharan africa and norte chico

2807 hunter gatherers tend to have an egalitarian social ethos   although settled hunter gatherers   for example   those inhabiting the northwest coast of north america   are an exception to this rule   nearly all african hunter gatherers are egalitarian   with women roughly as influential and powerful as men

2808 the egalitarianism typical of human hunters and gatherers is never total   but is striking when viewed in an evolutionary context   one of humanity  s two closest primate relatives   chimpanzees   are anything but egalitarian   forming themselves into hierarchies that are often dominated by an alpha male   so great is the contrast with human hunter gatherers that it is widely argued by palaeoanthropologists that resistance to being dominated was a key factor driving the evolutionary emergence of human consciousness   language   kinship and social organization

2809 anthropologists maintain that hunter gatherers do n t have permanent leaders   instead   the person taking the initiative at any one time depends on the task being performed   in addition to social and economic equality in hunter gatherer societies   there is often   though not always   sexual parity as well   hunter gatherers are often grouped together based on kinship and band   or tribe   membership   postmarital residence among hunter gatherers tends to be matrilocal   at least initially   young mothers can enjoy childcare support from their own mothers   who continue living nearby in the same camp   the systems of kinship and descent among human hunter gatherers were relatively flexible   although there is evidence that early human kinship in general tended to be matrilineal

2810 it is easy for western educated scholars to fall into the trap of viewing hunter gatherer social and sexual arrangements in the light of western values     editorializing   one common arrangement is the sexual division of labour   with women doing most of the gathering   while men concentrate on big game hunting   it might be imagined that this arrangement oppresses women   keeping them in the domestic sphere   however   according to some observers   hunter gatherer women would not understand this interpretation   since childcare is collective   with every baby having multiple mothers and male carers   the domestic sphere is not atomised or privatised but an empowering place to be     citation needed   in all hunter gatherer societies   women appreciate the meat brought back to camp by men   an illustrative account is megan biesele  s study of the southern african ju  hoan    women like meat     recent archaeological research suggests that the sexual division of labor was the fundamental organisational innovation that gave homo sapiens the edge over the neanderthals   allowing our ancestors to migrate from africa and spread across the globe

2811 to this day   most hunter gatherers have a symbolically structured sexual division of labour   however   it is true that in a small minority of cases   women hunt the same kind of quarry as men   sometimes doing so alongside men   the best known example are the aeta people of the philippines   according to one study      about 85   of philippine aeta women hunt   and they hunt the same quarry as men   aeta women hunt in groups and with dogs   and have a 31   success rate as opposed to 17   for men   their rates are even better when they combine forces with men   mixed hunting groups have a full 41   success rate among the aeta      among the ju  hoansi people of namibia   women help men track down quarry   women in the australian martu also primarily hunt small animals like lizards to feed their children and maintain relations with other women

2812 at the 1966    man the hunter    conference   anthropologists richard borshay lee and irven devore suggested that egalitarianism was one of several central characteristics of nomadic hunting and gathering societies because mobility requires minimization of material possessions throughout a population   therefore   no surplus of resources can be accumulated by any single member   other characteristics lee and devore proposed were flux in territorial boundaries as well as in demographic composition

2813 at the same conference   marshall sahlins presented a paper entitled      notes on the original affluent society      in which he challenged the popular view of hunter gatherers lives as    solitary   poor   nasty   brutish and short      as thomas hobbes had put it in 1651  according to sahlins   ethnographic data indicated that hunter gatherers worked far fewer hours and enjoyed more leisure than typical members of industrial society   and they still ate well   their    affluence    came from the idea that they were satisfied with very little in the material sense   later   in 1996   ross sackett performed two distinct meta analyses to empirically test sahlin  s view   the first of these studies looked at 102 time allocation studies   and the second one analyzed 207 energy expenditure studies   sackett found that adults in foraging and horticultural societies work   on average   about 6 5 hours a day   where as people in agricultural and industrial societies work on average 8 8 hours a day

2815 hunter gatherer societies manifest significant variability   depending on climate zone life zone   available technology and societal structure   archaeologists examine hunter gatherer tool kits to measure variability across different groups   collard et al     2005   found temperature to be the only statistically significant factor to impact hunter gatherer tool kits   using temperature as a proxy for risk   collard et al    s results suggest that environments with extreme temperatures pose a threat to hunter gatherer systems significant enough to warrant increased variability of tools   these results support torrence  s   1989   theory that risk of failure is indeed the most important factor in determining the structure of hunter gatherer toolkits

2816 one way to divide hunter gatherer groups is by their return systems   james woodburn uses the categories    immediate return    hunter gatherers for egalitarian and    delayed return    for nonegalitarian   immediate return foragers consume their food within a day or two after they procure it   delayed return foragers store the surplus food   kelly   31

2817 hunting gathering was the common human mode of subsistence throughout the paleolithic   but the observation of current day hunters and gatherers does not necessarily reflect paleolithic societies   the hunter gatherer cultures examined today have had much contact with modern civilization and do not represent    pristine    conditions found in uncontacted peoples

2818 the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is not necessarily a one way process   it has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy   which may still be exploited   if necessary   when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists   in fact   it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter gatherer societies   especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion that has occurred in the last 10 000 years     citation needed   this anthropological view has remained unchanged since the 1960s     clarification needed     citation needed

2819 in the early 1980s   a small but vocal segment of anthropologists and archaeologists attempted to demonstrate that contemporary groups usually identified as hunter gatherers do not   in most cases   have a continuous history of hunting and gathering   and that in many cases their ancestors were agriculturalists and or pastoralists   citation needed   who were pushed into marginal areas as a result of migrations   economic exploitation   and or violent conflict   see   for example   the kalahari debate     the result of their effort has been the general acknowledgement that there has been complex interaction between hunter gatherers and non hunter gatherers for millennia     citation needed

2820 some of the theorists who advocate this    revisionist    critique imply that   because the    pure hunter gatherer    disappeared not long after colonial   or even agricultural   contact began   nothing meaningful can be learned about prehistoric hunter gatherers from studies of modern ones   kelly   24 29   see wilmsen

2822 many hunter gatherers consciously manipulate the landscape through cutting or burning undesirable plants while encouraging desirable ones   some even going to the extent of slash and burn to create habitat for game animals   these activities are on an entirely different scale to those associated with agriculture   but they are nevertheless domestication on some level   today   almost all hunter gatherers depend to some extent upon domesticated food sources either produced part time or traded for products acquired in the wild

2823 some agriculturalists also regularly hunt and gather   e g    farming during the frost free season and hunting during the winter     still others in developed countries go hunting   primarily for leisure   in the brazilian rainforest   those groups that recently did   or even continue to   rely on hunting and gathering techniques seem to have adopted this lifestyle   abandoning most agriculture   as a way to escape colonial control and as a result of the introduction of european diseases reducing their populations to levels where agriculture became difficult     citation needed     dubious   discuss

2826 hunter gatherers would eventually flourish all over the americas   primarily based in the great plains of the united states and canada   with offshoots as far east as the gasp  peninsula on the atlantic coast   and as far south as chile   monte verde     citation needed   american hunter gatherers were spread over a wide geographical area   thus there were regional variations in lifestyles   however   all the individual groups shared a common style of stone tool production   making knapping styles and progress identifiable   this early paleo indian period lithic reduction tool adaptations have been found across the americas   utilized by highly mobile bands consisting of approximately 25 to 50 members of an extended family

2887 soon   laemmle and other disgruntled nickelodeon owners decided to avoid paying edison by producing their own pictures   in june 1909   laemmle started the yankee film company with partners abe stern and julius stern   that company quickly evolved into the independent moving pictures company   imp     with studios in fort lee   new jersey   where many early films in america  s first motion picture industry were produced in the early 20th century   laemmle broke with edison  s custom of refusing to give billing and screen credits to performers   by naming the movie stars   he attracted many of the leading players of the time   contributing to the creation of the star system   in 1910   he promoted florence lawrence   formerly known as    the biograph girl      and actor king baggot   in what may be the first instance of a studio using stars in its marketing

2891 despite laemmle  s role as an innovator   he was an extremely cautious studio chief   unlike rivals adolph zukor   william fox   and marcus loew   laemmle chose not to develop a theater chain   he also financed all of his own films   refusing to take on debt   this policy nearly bankrupted the studio when actor director erich von stroheim insisted on excessively lavish production values for his films blind husbands   1919   and foolish wives   1922     but universal shrewdly gained a return on some of the expenditure by launching a sensational ad campaign that attracted moviegoers   character actor lon chaney became a drawing card for universal in the 1920s   appearing steadily in dramas   his two biggest hits for universal were the hunchback of notre dame   1923   and the phantom of the opera   1925     during this period laemmle entrusted most of the production policy decisions to irving thalberg   thalberg had been laemmle  s personal secretary   and laemmle was impressed by his cogent observations of how efficiently the studio could be operated   promoted to studio chief   thalberg was giving universal  s product a touch of class   but mgm  s head of production louis b  mayer lured thalberg away from universal with a promise of better pay   without his guidance universal became a second tier studio   and would remain so for several decades

2894 universal owned the rights to the    oswald the lucky rabbit    character   although walt disney and ub iwerks had created oswald   and their films had enjoyed a successful theatrical run   after charles mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that disney accept a lower fee for producing the property   mintz produced the films with his own group of animators   instead   disney and iwerks created mickey mouse who in 1928 stared in the first    sync    sound animated short   steamboat willie   this moment effectively launched walt disney studios   foothold   while universal became a minor player in film animation   universal subsequently severed its link to mintz and formed its own in house animation studio to produce oswald cartoons headed by walter lantz

2899 universal  s forays into high quality production spelled the end of the laemmle era at the studio   taking on the task of modernizing and upgrading a film conglomerate in the depths of the depression was risky   and for a time universal slipped into receivership   the theater chain was scrapped   but carl   jr  held fast to distribution   studio and production operations

2900 the end for the laemmles came with a lavish version of show boat   1936     a remake of its earlier 1929 part talkie production   and produced as a high quality   big budget film rather than as a b picture   the new film featured several stars from the broadway stage version   which began production in late 1935   and unlike the 1929 film was based on the broadway musical rather than the novel   carl   jr   s spending habits alarmed company stockholders   they would not allow production to start on show boat unless the laemmles obtained a loan   universal was forced to seek a   750 000 production loan from the standard capital corporation   pledging the laemmle family  s controlling interest in universal as collateral   it was the first time universal had borrowed money for a production in its 26 year history   the production went   300 000 over budget   standard called in the loan   cash strapped universal could not pay   standard foreclosed and seized control of the studio on april 2   1936

2902 meanwhile   producer joe pasternak   who had been successfully producing light musicals with young sopranos for universal  s german subsidiary   repeated his formula in america   teenage singer deanna durbin starred in pasternak  s first american film   three smart girls   1936     the film was a box office hit and reputedly restored the studio  s solvency   the success of the film led universal to offer her a contract   which for the first five years of her career produced her most successful pictures

2903 when pasternak stopped producing durbin  s pictures   and she outgrew her screen persona and pursued more dramatic roles   the studio signed 13 year old gloria jean for her own series of pasternak musicals from 1939   she went on to star with bing crosby   w  c  fields   and donald o connor   a popular universal film of the late 1930s was destry rides again   1939     starring james stewart as destry and marlene dietrich in her comeback role after leaving paramount studios

2905 universal could seldom afford its own stable of stars   and often borrowed talent from other studios   or hired freelance actors   in addition to stewart and dietrich   margaret sullavan   and bing crosby were two of the major names that made a couple of pictures for universal during this period   some stars came from radio   including edgar bergen   w  c  fields   and the comedy team of abbott and costello   bud abbott and lou costello     abbott and costello  s military comedy buck privates   1941   gave the former burlesque comedians a national and international profile

2910 the production arm of the studio still struggled   while there were to be a few hits like the killers   1946   and the naked city   1948     universal international  s new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office   by the late 1940s   goetz was out   and the studio returned to low budget films   the inexpensive francis   1950     the first film of a series about a talking mule and ma and pa kettle   1949     part of a series   became mainstays of the company   once again   the films of abbott and costello   including abbott and costello meet frankenstein   1948     were among the studio  s top grossing productions   but at this point rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor milton rackmil   whose decca records would take full control of universal in 1952  besides abbott and costello   the studio retained the walter lantz cartoon studio   whose product was released with universal international  s films

2912 though decca would continue to keep picture budgets lean   it was favored by changing circumstances in the film business   as other studios let their contract actors go in the wake of the 1948 u s  vs  paramount pictures   et al   decision   leading actors were increasingly free to work where and when they chose   and in 1950 mca agent lew wasserman made a deal with universal for his client james stewart that would change the rules of the business   wasserman  s deal gave stewart a share in the profits of three pictures in lieu of a large salary   when one of those films   winchester  73   proved to be a hit   the arrangement would become the rule for many future productions at universal   and eventually at other studios as well

2930 as a child   young bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world   resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age   his best friend was ben herdman   a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill   the scene of many forays   young bell asked what needed to be done at the mill   he was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12   bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes   creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years   in return   john herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to    invent

2931 from his early years   bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art   poetry   and music that was encouraged by his mother   with no formal training   he mastered the piano and became the family  s pianist   despite being normally quiet and introspective   he reveled in mimicry and    voice tricks    akin to ventriloquism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits   bell was also deeply affected by his mother  s gradual deafness     she began to lose her hearing when he was 12   and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour   he also developed a technique of speaking in clear   modulated tones directly into his mother  s forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity   bell  s preoccupation with his mother  s deafness led him to study acoustics

2932 his family was long associated with the teaching of elocution   his grandfather   alexander bell   in london   his uncle in dublin   and his father   in edinburgh   were all elocutionists   his father published a variety of works on the subject   several of which are still well known   especially his the standard elocutionist   1860     which appeared in edinburgh in 1868  the standard elocutionist appeared in 168 british editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the united states alone   in this treatise   his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf mutes   as they were then known   to articulate words and read other people  s lip movements to decipher meaning   bell  s father taught him and his brothers not only to write visible speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound   bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father  s public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities   he could decipher visible speech representing virtually every language   including latin   scottish gaelic   and even sanskrit   accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation

2933 as a young child   bell   like his brothers   received his early schooling at home from his father   at an early age   however   he was enrolled at the royal high school   edinburgh   scotland   which he left at age 15   completing only the first four forms   his school record was undistinguished   marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades   his main interest remained in the sciences   especially biology   while he treated other school subjects with indifference   to the dismay of his demanding father   upon leaving school   bell travelled to london to live with his grandfather   alexander bell   during the year he spent with his grandfather   a love of learning was born   with long hours spent in serious discussion and study   the elder bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction   the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself   at age 16   bell secured a position as a    pupil teacher    of elocution and music   in weston house academy   at elgin   moray   scotland   although he was enrolled as a student in latin and greek   he instructed classes himself in return for board and  10 per session   the following year   he attended the university of edinburgh   joining his older brother melville who had enrolled there the previous year   in 1868   not long before he departed for canada with his family   bell completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the university of london

2934 his father encouraged bell  s interest in speech and   in 1863   took his sons to see a unique automaton   developed by sir charles wheatstone based on the earlier work of baron wolfgang von kempelen   the rudimentary    mechanical man    simulated a human voice   bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von kempelen  s book   published in german   and had laboriously translated it   he and his older brother melville built their own automaton head   their father   highly interested in their project   offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a    big prize    if they were successful   while his brother constructed the throat and larynx   bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull   his efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could    speak      albeit only a few words   the boys would carefully adjust the    lips    and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe   a very recognizable    mama    ensued   to the delight of neighbors who came to see the bell invention

2935 intrigued by the results of the automaton   bell continued to experiment with a live subject   the family  s skye terrier      trouve      after he taught it to growl continuously   bell would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog  s lips and vocal cords to produce a crude sounding    ow ah oo ga ma ma      with little convincing   visitors believed his dog could articulate    how are you grandma      more indicative of his playful nature   his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a    talking dog      however   these initial forays into experimentation with sound led bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound   using tuning forks to explore resonance

2936 at the age of 19   he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist alexander ellis   a colleague of his father   who would later be portrayed as professor henry higgins in pygmalion     ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in germany   and also lent bell a copy of hermann von helmholtz  s work   the sensations of tone as a physiological basis for the theory of music

2937 dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork    contraption      he pored over the german scientist  s book   working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a french edition   bell fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound   reporting      without knowing much about the subject   it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means   so could consonants   so could articulate speech      he also later remarked      i thought that helmholtz had done it     and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity   it was a valuable blunder     if i had been able to read german in those days   i might never have commenced my experiments        n 7

2938 in 1865   when the bell family moved to london   bell returned to weston house as an assistant master and   in his spare hours   continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment   bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in somerset college to that of a friend   throughout late 1867   his health faltered mainly through exhaustion   his younger brother   edward    ted      was similarly bed ridden   suffering from tuberculosis   while bell recovered   by then referring to himself in correspondence as    a g  bell      and served the next year as an instructor at somerset college   bath   england   his brother  s condition deteriorated   edward would never recover   upon his brother  s death   bell returned home in 1867  his older brother melville had married and moved out   with aspirations to obtain a degree at university college london   bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations   devoting his spare time at his family  s residence to studying

2939 helping his father in visible speech demonstrations and lectures brought bell to susanna e  hull  s private school for the deaf in south kensington   london   his first two pupils were    deaf mute    girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage   while his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school   applying for a patent on an invention   and starting a family   bell continued as a teacher   however   in may 1870   melville died from complications due to tuberculosis   causing a family crisis   his father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in newfoundland   bell  s parents embarked upon a long planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly   acting decisively   alexander melville bell asked bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property     n 8   conclude all of his brother  s affairs   bell took over his last student   curing a pronounced lisp     and join his father and mother in setting out for the    new world      reluctantly   bell also had to conclude a relationship with marie eccleston   who   as he had surmised   was not prepared to leave england with him

2940 in 1870   at age 23   bell   his brother  s widow   caroline   margaret ottaway     and his parents travelled on the ss nestorian to canada   after landing at quebec city the bells transferred to another steamer to montreal and then boarded a train to paris   ontario   to stay with the reverend thomas henderson   a family friend   after a brief stay with the hendersons   the bell family purchased a farm of 10 5 acres   42 000 m2   at tutelo heights   now called tutela heights     near brantford   ontario   the property consisted of an orchard   large farm house   stable   pigsty   hen house   and a carriage house   which bordered the grand river     n 9

2942 after setting up his workshop   bell continued experiments based on helmholtz  s work with electricity and sound   he also modified a melodeon   a type of pump organ   so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance   once the family was settled in   both bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 1871   he accompanied his father to montreal   where melville was offered a position to teach his system of visible speech

2943 bell  s father was invited by sarah fuller   principal of the boston school for deaf mutes   which continues today as the public horace mann school for the deaf     in boston   massachusetts   to introduce the visible speech system by providing training for fuller  s instructors   but he declined the post in favor of his son   traveling to boston in april 1871   bell proved successful in training the school  s instructors   he was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the american asylum for deaf mutes in hartford   connecticut   and the clarke school for the deaf in northampton   massachusetts

2944 unsure of his future   he first contemplated returning to london to complete his studies   but decided to return to boston as a teacher   his father helped him set up his private practice by contacting gardiner greene hubbard   the president of the clarke school for the deaf for a recommendation   teaching his father  s system   in october 1872   alexander bell opened his    school of vocal physiology and mechanics of speech    in boston   which attracted a large number of deaf pupils   with his first class numbering 30 students   while he was working as a private tutor   one of his most famous pupils was helen keller   who came to him as a young child unable to see   hear   or speak   she was later to say that bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that    inhuman silence which separates and estranges      in 1893   keller performed the sod breaking ceremony for the construction of the new bell  s new volta bureau   dedicated to    the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf

2945 several influential people of the time   including bell   viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated   and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language   thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded   in several schools   children were mistreated   for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing the only language they knew in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication   owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language   bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing deaf culture

2946 in the following year   bell became professor of vocal physiology and elocution at the boston university school of oratory   during this period   he alternated between boston and brantford   spending summers in his canadian home   at boston university   bell was    swept up    by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city   he continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech   but although absorbed by his experiments   he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation   while days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes   bell began to stay awake late into the night   running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house   keeping    night owl    hours   he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment   bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover   worse still   his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches   returning to boston in fall 1873   bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound

2947 deciding to give up his lucrative private boston practice   bell retained only two students   six year old    georgie    sanders   deaf from birth   and 15 year old mabel hubbard   each pupil would play an important role in the next developments   george  s father   thomas sanders   a wealthy businessman   offered bell a place to stay in nearby salem with georgie  s grandmother   complete with a room to    experiment      although the offer was made by george  s mother and followed the year long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to bell  s boarding house   it was clear that mr  sanders was backing the proposal   the arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together   with free room and board thrown in   mabel was a bright   attractive girl who was ten years bell  s junior   but became the object of his affection   having lost her hearing after a near fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday     n 13   she had learned to read lips but her father   gardiner greene hubbard   bell  s benefactor and personal friend   wanted her to work directly with her teacher

2948 by 1874   bell  s initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage   with progress made both at his new boston    laboratory      a rented facility   and at his family home in canada a big success     n 14   while working that summer in brantford   bell experimented with a    phonautograph      a pen like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations   bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves   bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound   but he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas

2949 in 1874   telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of western union president william orton   had become    the nervous system of commerce      orton had contracted with inventors thomas edison and elisha gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines   when bell mentioned to gardiner hubbard and thomas sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi reed device   the two wealthy patrons began to financially support bell  s experiments   patent matters would be handled by hubbard  s patent attorney   anthony pollok

2950 in march 1875   bell and pollok visited the famous scientist joseph henry   who was then director of the smithsonian institution   and asked henry  s advice on the electrical multi reed apparatus that bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph   henry replied that bell had    the germ of a great invention      when bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge   henry replied      get it      that declaration greatly encouraged bell to keep trying   even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments   nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas   however   a chance meeting in 1874 between bell and thomas a  watson   an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of charles williams   changed all that

2951 with financial support from sanders and hubbard   bell hired thomas watson as his assistant     n 15   and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraphy   on june 2   1875   watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and bell   at the receiving end of the wire   heard the overtones of the reed   overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech   that demonstrated to bell that only one reed or armature was necessary   not multiple reeds   this led to the    gallows    sound powered telephone   which could transmit indistinct   voice like sounds   but not clear speech

2952 in 1875   bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it   since he had agreed to share u s  profits with his investors gardiner hubbard and thomas sanders   bell requested that an associate in ontario   george brown   attempt to patent it in britain   instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the u s  only after they received word from britain   britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere

2953 meanwhile   elisha gray was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter   on february 14   1876   gray filed a caveat with the u s  patent office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter   that same morning   bell  s lawyer filed bell  s application with the patent office   there is considerable debate about who arrived first and gray later challenged the primacy of bell  s patent   bell was in boston on february 14 and did not arrive in washington until february 26

2954 bell  s patent 174 465   was issued to bell on march 7   1876   by the u s  patent office   bell  s patent covered    the method of   and apparatus for   transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically     by causing electrical undulations   similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound      n 16   bell returned to boston the same day and the next day resumed work   drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in gray  s patent caveat

2955 on march 10   1876   three days after his patent was issued   bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work   using a liquid transmitter similar to gray  s design   vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water   varying the electrical resistance in the circuit   when bell spoke the famous sentence    mr  watson come here i want to see you    into the liquid transmitter   watson   listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room   heard the words clearly

2956 although bell was   and still is   accused of stealing the telephone from gray   bell used gray  s water transmitter design only after bell  s patent had been granted   and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment   to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible    articulate speech      bell  s words   could be electrically transmitted   after march 1876   bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used gray  s liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use

2957 the question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved bell  s patent application   he told bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in gray  s caveat   bell pointed to a variable resistance device in bell  s previous application in which bell described a cup of mercury   not water   bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on february 25   1875   long before elisha gray described the water device   in addition   gray abandoned his caveat   and because he did not contest bell  s priority   the examiner approved bell  s patent on march 3   1876  gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone   but bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone

2958 the patent examiner   zenas fisk wilber   later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to bell  s lawyer   marcellus bailey   with whom he had served in the civil war   he claimed he showed gray  s patent caveat to bailey   wilber also claimed   after bell arrived in washington d c  from boston   that he showed gray  s caveat to bell and that bell paid him   100   bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms   although in a letter to gray   bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details   bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave wilber any money

2959 continuing his experiments in brantford   bell brought home a working model of his telephone   on august 3   1876   from the telegraph office in mount pleasant five miles   eight km   away from brantford   bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready   with curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses   faint voices were heard replying   the following night   he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the bell home from brantford   four miles   six km   distant   along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences   and laid through a tunnel   this time   guests at the household distinctly heard people in brantford reading and singing   these experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances

2960 bell and his partners   hubbard and sanders   offered to sell the patent outright to western union for   100 000   the president of western union balked   countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy   two years later   he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for   25 million he would consider it a bargain   by then   the bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent   bell  s investors would become millionaires   while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars

2961 bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public   a short time later   his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 1876 centennial exposition in philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention   influential visitors to the exhibition included emperor pedro ii of brazil   later bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to sir william thomson   later   lord kelvin     a renowned scottish scientist   as well as to queen victoria   who had requested a private audience at osborne house   her isle of wight home   she called the demonstration    most extraordinary      the enthusiasm surrounding bell  s public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device

2964 as is sometimes common in scientific discoveries   simultaneous developments can occur   as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone   over a period of 18 years   the bell telephone company faced 587 court challenges to its patents   including five that went to the u s  supreme court   but none was successful in establishing priority over the original bell patent and the bell telephone company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage   bell  s laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments   the bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by elisha gray and amos dolbear   in personal correspondence to bell   both gray and dolbear had acknowledged his prior work   which considerably weakened their later claims

2966 during a deposition filed for the 1887 trial   italian inventor antonio meucci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in italy in 1834  in 1886   in the first of three cases in which he was involved   meucci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention  s priority   meucci  s evidence in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of american district telegraph   adt   of new york   which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of western union in 1901  meucci  s work   like many other inventors of the period   was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments   the final case involving meucci was eventually dropped upon meucci  s death   however   due to the efforts of congressman vito fossella   the u s  house of representatives on june 11   2002 stated that meucci  s    work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged      even though this did not put an end to a still contentious issue     n 17   some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that bell  s work on the telephone was influenced by meucci  s inventions     n 18

2967 the value of the bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world   and patent applications were made in most major countries   but when bell had delayed the german patent application   the electrical firm of siemens   halske   s   h   managed to set up a rival manufacturer of bell telephones under their own patent   the siemens company produced near identical copies of the bell telephone without having to pay royalties   the establishment of the international bell telephone company in brussels   belgium in 1880   as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation   the strain put on bell by his constant appearances in court   necessitated by the legal battles   eventually resulted in his resignation from the company     n 19

2973 although alexander graham bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone   his interests were extremely varied   according to one of his biographers   charlotte gray   bell  s work ranged    unfettered across the scientific landscape    and he often went to bed voraciously reading the encyclop dia britannica   scouring it for new areas of interest   the range of bell  s inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators   these included 14 for the telephone and telegraph   four for the photophone   one for the phonograph   five for aerial vehicles   four for    hydroairplanes    and two for selenium cells   bell  s inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing   the audiometer to detect minor hearing problems   a device to locate icebergs   investigations on how to separate salt from seawater   and work on finding alternative fuels

2979 bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector in 1881  the device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of u s  president james garfield   according to some accounts   the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin  s bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the president was lying disturbed the instrument   resulting in static   the president  s surgeons   who were skeptical of the device   ignored bell  s requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs   alternatively   although bell had detected a slight sound on his first test   the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus

2980 bell  s own detailed account   presented to the american association for the advancement of science in 1882   differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation   most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet   perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of garfield   bell        proceeded to the executive mansion the next morning     to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed   it was then recollected that underneath the horse hair mattress on which the president lay was another mattress composed of steel wires   upon obtaining a duplicate   the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires   with large meshes   the extent of the   area that produced a response from the detector   having been so small   as compared with the area of the bed   it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect      in a footnote   bell adds that    the death of president garfield and the subsequent post mortem examination   however   proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus

2981 the march 1906 scientific american article by american pioneer william e  meacham explained the basic principle of hydrofoils and hydroplanes   bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement   based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat   bell and assistant frederick w     casey    baldwin began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water   baldwin studied the work of the italian inventor enrico forlanini and began testing models   this led him and bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft
