# 07/11/2017 After class meeting

6 weeks and 12 meetings left

Let’s get our project go parallel: Studying new models, and thinking about the ultimate goal of the project, for now,

- Think about how to extract knowledge from the big dataset (go to Dbpedia, and Freebase), for reference [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) of Stanford.
- If you ask a new question that our model couldn’t catch, how our model gonna deal with that? 

## 1. Due 07/14/2017

- Implement chatbot using seq2seq model
    + goal: get to know how it works, how well it performs, and the downside of the model
- Study GRU (just like what we did on Seq2Seq model)
- Find best parameters of the Word2Vec model that we implemented earlier (Tweak it, give some variations, play with it)

## 2. For the coming week after next week:

- Study memory network
- Study end-to-end network
