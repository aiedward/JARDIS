# Progress notes

## Online meeting on 07/09/2017

### 1. Due 07/11/2017
- Understanding LSTM, RNN and do the tutorial of tensorflow seq to seq model
- Read the paper ["Sequence to Sequence Learning
with Neural Networks"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5346-sequence-to-sequence-learning-with-neural-networks.pdf)

### 2. Due 07/16/2017
- We found the Korean WordSim dataset(https://github.com/dongjun-Lee/kor2vec) similar with WordSim353.
- Using the above kor2vec dataset as a golden dataset, calculate MSE or Pearson correlation score with our model implemented by gensim wv module.
    + MSE is implemented in scikit-learn
    + Pearson correlation is in scipy.
- We can find the best word2vec parameter.(window size) Usually 8 is the best.
- Try CBOW, SkipGram, Glove, Kor2vec and see which one is better.
