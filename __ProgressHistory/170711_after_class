071117 After class meeting

6 weeks and 12 meetings left

Let’s get our project go parallel: Studying new models, and thinking about the ultimate goal of the project, for now, 

1) Think about how to extract knowledge from the big dataset (go to Dbpedia, and Freebase), for reference SQAD of Stanford.

2) If you ask a new question that our model couldn’t catch, how our model gonna deal with that? 

For the next week: [Due Friday]
1-a. implement chatbot using seq2sesq model 
(goal: get to know how it works, how well it performs, and the downside of the model)
1-b. Study GRU (just like what we did on Seq2seq model)
1-c. Find best parameters of the Word2Vec model that we implemented earlier
(Tweak it, give some variations, play with it)

For the coming week after next week:
2-a. Study memory network
2-b. Study end-to-end network
